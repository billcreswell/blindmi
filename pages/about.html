<h2>About the Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired (MCBVI):</h2>

<p>
    MCBVI is the Michigan affiliate of the American Council of the Blind. We are a diverse group of very friendly people from around the state working together to improve the lives of all citizens who are blind or visually impaired. We do this through advocacy, education, fellowship, and connection to resources. We have members who are blind, visually impaired, and fully sighted, and if you are not a member we would welcome you too! We have 5 local chapters and are working to seed new ones. We also have many members at large from all corners of the state.

    We are working to add fresh material to our website so we hope you will return often. Please take a few minutes to look around and you will find some of our newsletters and other content that we hope you will find interesting.
