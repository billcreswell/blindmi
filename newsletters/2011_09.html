From the President

By Joe Sibley

As we head into this holiday season and prepare to launch another new year I am reflecting on the many events, challenges, and accomplishments of the past year. We faced some challenges regarding the Michigan Commission for the Blind board and raised our voices together. We have seen some chapters flourish while others are struggling. We have welcomed many new members from around the state who appreciate our message of positivity and productivity, not conflict for the sake of conflict. We have put Michigan back on the radar of our national ACB leadership. We are still facing challenges in this organization, but more and more great people are learning about what MCBVI represents and are joining their voice with us.

Let me address a problem that we need to look at, all of us together. We need to address our financial challenges. Our income has dropped significantly causing us to dip into our investment reserves to cover our basic expenses. This is not acceptable as we have had to make some cuts to the productive work we could be doing to benefit all of the blind and visually impaired citizens of Michigan. It is also bad for the long term future of this organization. If we do not increase our funding, MCBVI could someday cease to exist, and that would be a tragedy. I know what this organization has done for me personally and so many others over the years. I see the potential of what we could accomplish that would benefit so many people, youth and adults alike. We work hard to keep the cost of participating in this organization low both in dues and convention expenses. Of your membership dues, MCBVI receives five dollars. Sadly, that does not go very far these days. It is not often that we ask for extra donations, but as it is the end of the year and some people could use some tax deductible donations, perhaps you would consider an extra gift to the MCBVI general budget. I will put the address to send donations to at the end of this message. I realize that many of our members are unable to do that, which is fine. But for those that could spare an extra gift this year we will be very careful to put your funds to productive use. We are a registered 501c3 organization so your donations are tax deductible. Thank you in advance for at least considering this. 

One less painful way to help MCBVI is to participate in the ACB MMS or Monthly Monetary Support program. You can elect to have 10 dollars or more automatically deducted from your checking account or credit card each month. You can designate up to 50 percent of that amount to be sent to MCBVI. Mary and I are personally participating in the program. Even with a deduction of 10 dollars per month, 5 dollars will go to ACB and 5 dollars can come to Michigan to support MCBVI. A few of those can make a big difference in our budget. See the ACB website for how to contact them to participate in the MMS program.

As of this writing our 2011 convention is a few weeks behind us, and what a wonderful convention it was. Our convention is always one of my favorite events of the year. We are able to accomplish so much business and education while still enjoying the wonderful fellowship that this organization offers. I was especially pleased to see many new faces at convention, along with many who haven't been to a convention in a while. If I try to thank everyone who helped make this convention a success I will miss some key people, so a very warm thank you to everyone who helped or attended the convention. The Causeway Bay Hotel and Convention Center in Lansing gave us many more options for meeting space. More than 50 enjoyed our cruise Thursday night aboard the Michigan Princess Riverboat. We tried new things such as the continuing education presentation for social workers conducted by Donna Rose that was very well received and will be repeated next year. We had many teachers attending our presentations Friday. We had a much larger hospitality suite which many members and guests were able to enjoy.

I do have to recognize Casey Dutmer who stepped up during the preparation to assume the role of convention chair which he will continue next year. Sharon Dutmer again coordinated registration, finances, and hospitality, as she and Casey have done for four years now. Our convention committee included the Dutmers, Donna Rose, Mary Sibley, Michelle Visscher, Malaina VanderWal, Lisa Weber, and Cheyenne Blakeman. Thank you to the committee and the many many people that helped in any capacity. Look for more information about the 2011 convention later in this issue, along with the resolutions passed by our membership.

One of the most amazing experiences at this year's convention was to welcome Mitch Pomerantz, president of the American Council of the Blind. Mitch flew in Thursday and stayed until early Sunday morning so in addition to his presentations many of our members were able to speak personally with Mitch. Mitch's remarks as our banquet keynote speaker charged up all of us in attendance. If you heard that speech, you know who we are and why we are here, and how different we are as part of ACB than other blind consumer organizations. I hope to have that speech available on our website soon.  I could ramble on about the convention for several more pages, but Donna needs space for other things so I will stop, but plan on attending the 2012 convention which will be earlier, September 13-16, 2012. Watch for details.

I will also put in a quick plug for the national ACB convention in July. Mary and I along with 10 others from Michigan were able to attend the 2011 convention in Reno. If you have never attended a national convention, it is life changing. The 2012 national convention is in Louisville Kentucky in July. I hope many of our members will join us as it is a much easier trip.

I have much more I would like to talk about, but let me close by wishing everyone a joyous and blessed holiday season,  and we look forward to new adventures and projects for MCBVI in 2012. As always, feel free to contact me if you have questions or comments. Thanks!

Help MCBVI by Joining ACB's Monthly Monetary Support (MMS) Two-for-One Program
From the ACB Web Site

If you are an ACB member, would you like to be able to help your state affiliate or an affiliate of your choice, and at the same time, assist the ACB at the national level too? Well, now you can by participating in the new and improved "Two-for-One" MMS Program. 
Now, when you take part in the MMS Program, the funds are deducted from the account you designate, on a regular, monthly bases, as before, but with the change implemented by the ACB Board, you can designate to have all of the funds go to the national organization or you can, alternatively, designate an amount up to 50% of the net amount of your deduction to be given to an affiliate of your choice. This change allows you the choice of helping both the national organization and an affiliate of your choice at the same time. You can help two levels of our organization with one monthly deduction, thus, two-for-one! The affiliate you choose can be any of the state affiliates or any other ACB affiliate you wish. 
All amounts are greatly appreciated, no matter how small or large! The ACB financial office in Minneapolis, Minnesota will withdraw the amount you indicate each month from your credit card, or your bank account. All contributions are kept completely confidential. This is an excellent way in which you can provide support for the American Council of the Blind. 
To participate in the ACB Monthly Monetary Support Program, you can either enroll online at acb.org, Or by calling ACB's Finance Office at 1-800-866-3242.
If you have any questions or need additional assistance, please call the ACB office at the number above, or drop us a note at Info@ACB.Org . 
Thank you in advance for your participation in the MMS program. You are helping us to make a difference in the lives of those whom we serve.

MCBVI Accomplishments and Goals
By Charis Austin, Treasurer & Membership Chairperson

In 2011, MCBVI became more visible. We are regularly represented at meetings of the Michigan Commission for the Blind (MCB) and other gatherings of the blind community. We are letting the people of Michigan know that there is a consumer organization that practices and promotes positive and constructive dialogue, while still representing the concerns of all blind or visually impaired citizens of Michigan. This is demonstrated by more telephone calls asking for information about our organization.

We have provided financial and volunteer support for youth activities including Michigan Regional Braille Challenge™, the Braille-A-Thon which takes place on the lawn of the State Capitol in June, and activities at Camp Tuhsmeheta (Camp T). Members of the Executive Committee had a meeting with Sara Conrad, National President of ACB Students to discuss strategies for getting more youth involvement.

Each year the Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired (MCBVI) holds a convention which offers members a chance to share fellowship and learn about important issues and new technology. This year we took some chances and did some new things.  For example, we hosted a seminar for social workers regarding working with blind clients. Social workers attending received three continuing education units (CEU's).  In partnership with Michigan Dept. of Education Low Incidents Outreach (LIO) we held a seminar which provided an overview of Apple products.  We took a dinner cruise aboard the Michigan Princess Riverboat on the Grand River and with the help of owner Captain John, we were able to use this as a fund-raiser because he gave us a break on the price of tickets.

2012 GOALS

During a goal setting workshop At the convention three top priorities were chosen by members to guide our organization in the near future:

• Better communication with members,
• Mentoring members,
• Stronger presence with our legislature

Read more about ideas to achieve these goals in upcoming issues.

Our President's goals for the coming year include:

• Develop new funding sources to expand our efforts to assist blind and visually impaired youth and adults through grants, scholarships, and sponsorship of events.
• Work to expand local chapters, especially in the southeast corner of the state where organizing a chapter is difficult because of transit and other logistical issues.
• Expand marketing efforts to make MCBVI more visible and more accessible to those who would benefit by becoming involved. This will include additional media outreach and utilization of social networks.

George & Jennie Move to Retirement Centers
By Donna Rose, Friend

As many of you are aware, George Illingworth, and Jennie Baly are the senior members of MCBVI.  They have reached a point where they have begun a new chapter in their lives, and thus have moved to retirement centers where their needs can be better met.  While growing older can be difficult I think I can say they are both happy with their new homes.  They don't want to lose touch with their old friends so I am including their contact information here so you can call and/or write to them with cards or letters.  They both read Braille.

Developing a New MCBVI Chapter in Your Hometown
By Donna Rose, Editor

There are probably a trillion ways to create a new and successful MCBVI chapter where you live, but here are some tips for getting started.  

You must gather at least five people to start a new chapter.  If you don't know four other people, you can put up a flyer at your local talking book library, ask them to put a blurb in their newsletter regarding such interest, plan a meeting and place information about it for free in the events or calendar column of local newspapers, ask your local radio reading service to announce such a meeting with your contact info to its listeners, provide flyers to the Michigan Commission for the Blind for distribution to those living locally who may have an interest, place flyers at ophthalmologists or optometrists office with their permission, etc.  Always include your contact information in any advertising you do to try and develop your chapter.

After you have gathered at least five interested individuals you will have to devise a chapter name and come up with the rules and policies by which the chapter will operate.  These documents are called a constitution and bylaws.  At the same time you are developing your new chapter you will need to let MCBVI executive members know you are in the process of organizing a chapter.  They can guide you with the necessary resources which can help you establish a name and the other documents you will need to become an official chapter of MCBVI.  Along with these official documents you will be creating an executive board of directors with at least a president, vice president, secretary and treasurer, and deciding the terms of office for each.  In your bylaws you can allow for other positions, if needed, like a first and second vice president, or an assistant secretary or treasurer.  You will also need to determine the amount of your annual dues for each member, keeping in mind that your chapter will be required to pay $10 for each of your members to MCBVI for state and national dues.   Once you have your chapter's name, constitution and bylaws established you can ask for a charter from MCBVI.  If for any reason you must disband your chapter you will return your charter and any funds left in the chapter bank accounts to MCBVI.

Developing a good chapter takes commitment and dedication.  It is tricky to keep members interested, especially in the initial stages.  I would suggest you meet at a venue which is centrally located, possibly at a restaurant where there is separate room space and people can purchase the food of their choice on their own tab.  Often churches will offer space, but if this is the place you choose try and provide goodies for members to make it welcoming.  At the first meeting you will have to agree on a comfortable day, time and place for future meetings.  When making this decision, take into consideration members who work.  If you have a lot of working members you may want to have meetings in the evenings, during the dinner hour or on Saturdays.  

Your first few meetings will likely be centered on developing your chapter, preparing your constitution and bylaws and other related items discussed above.  Try and have a fun activity like social time, a door prize drawing, a short game to make meetings interesting.  Always make sure everyone introduces themselves at the beginning and always remind everyone when and where the next meeting will be held at the end.  Once you get rolling you may want to bring in speakers on topics of interest to your members.  Here at our Capital Area chapter we have had a representative from our local transit authority come and speak to us about paratransit, someone from our radio reading service come, and a person from our library services for the blind too.  They gave us information about their services and answered questions from members.  Advertise upcoming speakers so the community as a whole knows about the event.

Once established, ask members to join some committees.  I would recommend starting out with at least a hospitality/membership committee which can be those who welcome and recruit new members, and a fund-raising committee so your chapter can grow financially.

We would love to have new chapters develop all over Michigan.  There are many advantages to belonging to MCBVI.  We offer peer support, an annual state convention with topics of interest to those with vision challenges, blindness and visual impairment advocacy, and the strength which comes from being a part of something bigger than you.  If you are interested in starting a chapter please let our president, Joe Sibley, or one of our other executive board members know so they can be of assistance.

Video for Accessibility in Medical and Other Settings
Via Email From George Theriault, President & CEO
New Hampshire Association for the Blind

Editor's Note:  I watched this video on the youtube website and found it to be excellent.  This is a great story about advocacy.  The link is listed below.  Perhaps you can share it with your health providers. 

Last year, client members of the Advocacy Committee of the New Hampshire Association for the Blind shared personal stories about difficulties
they had experienced as persons who are blind or visually impaired in hospitals and other medical practices and facilities.  The group asked: "How can we change things?  "How can we train hospital staff so we can have the same access as sighted people?"

The decision was made: "Lets make a training video."  With this goal, the committee got serious, deciding what situations would best illustrate the problems blind and visually impaired people often face while getting medical care.

The committee met with Concord Hospital and discovered they had a partner with a strong interest - and the ability to produce training videos.  The Committee wrote the script, acted the roles, and trained hospital staff and volunteers.  The hospital filmed the video, partnering also with the New Hampshire Hospital Association, the NH Medical Society, and the Home Care Association of NH - total memberships of these partners total over 2,000 medical practices in New Hampshire alone.

This video is now available to all.  To Watch and\or Download: Go to: www.sightcenter.org - on the front page menu open Resources Tab, select Video Links, read the story of how the video came about and select Watch or Download.  You can also see it on YouTube:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlP7mCr3LmQ

It is the hope of the New Hampshire Association for the Blind, that any
organization that wishes may use this video for staff and volunteer
training purposes and to promote accessibility for persons who are blind
and visually impaired.  We also encourage others to create similar tools and disseminate them broadly.

BEDBUGS BECOMING SERIOUS PROBLEM IN AMERICA
By Donna Rose, Editor

Since some of us have more access to this information than others, I thought this might be good information to share with our members.  If you listen to the news of late you have probably heard stories about bedbug outbreaks in the U.S..  They are mainly found in hotels and can infestate your luggage and clothing hitching a ride back to your home.  Once in your house they are extremely difficult and expensive to eradicate.  As the name suggests, they like to live in your bed, biting you at night and cause a very bad rash with itching.  They also will live in furniture, carpets, clothing, curtains and many other places.  Recent stories have reported they transmit communicable diseases, like hepatitis.

Health professionals claim that European immigrants originally carried bedbugs to the United States. They were once common bed-fellows for most citizens here.  But they almost became extinct during the middle of the 20th  century with the invention of a strong pesticide called DDT. Health and environmental risks associated with DDT caused it to be banned in the second half of the century and, as a result, for the past 30 years the bedbug population has been steadily rising.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, the problem has reached epidemic levels.  Therefore it is important to learn about them, how they spread, and how to get rid of them quickly if you are unfortunate enough to meet up with them.   

While reading USAToday last spring I found a good resource to use to find out if a hotel you will be visiting has had a problem with them.  It is a bedbug registry.  You can visit www.bedbugregistry.com.  When I looked I found 151 motels, hotels and apartments which had reports of bedbugs right here in Michigan.  Most of them were located in Detroit, Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, but it seems as though they can be found all over.

When making a reservation with a motel or hotel across America you might want to inquire about what the facility is doing to protect guests from these insects.  It is recommended that you have someone sighted lift up the covers of the beds in your assigned room and look for black specs on the bed linens, which are the bedbug droppings.  They like to hide in the seams of the mattress and box springs, so check there too.  If you notice any signs of them, ask for another room.  Don't be shy about asking hotel staff to help you look.  Hotels don't want an outbreak and are as eager as you are to find them so treatment can begin.  When you arrive home from your trip you should leave your suitcase in a hot car for several hours.  The heat should kill any bugs which have stowed away.

Should your home become infested with bedbugs, you will want to immediately call a company familiar with methods of eradicating them.  These methods usually involve special heat treatments.  It is recommended that you not try store bought pesticides because they are ineffective and can be dangerous to your health, particularly where you sleep.  Never use kerosene or gasoline to try to get rid of them yourself because this is an extreme fire hazard.  Several people have been badly burned trying this method, and it is not effective.

For more great information on bedbugs and tips for avoiding or getting rid of them, visit www.michigan.gov/bedbugs.  Sleep well!!


Gone to the Dogs: Rules on Service Animals to Become Stricter
By James J.   McDonald, Jr., managing partner, Fisher and 
Phillips, LLP
( Editor's Note:  Taken from the ACB Human Service Providers Email List)

Regulations issued in 1991 following the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act required that public accommodations (which include restaurants, hotels, retail establishments, theaters, and concert halls) modify their 
policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability.   Essentially this means that service animals accompanying persons with disabilities have to be admitted to establishments with policies that otherwise exclude pets or other animals.

When the ADA was enacted, most service animals were "seeing-eye" dogs that assisted blind or sight-impaired persons.   In most cases, these dogs were highly trained and, because of their extensive training, were not likely to create a nuisance or a sanitary problem.

Over time, however, a variety of species came to be characterized by their owners as service animals, including pigs, horses, monkeys, snakes, lizards, birds, and rodents.   Also, dogs and other animals that merely provide emotional comfort to their owners have been characterized as service animals.

This proliferation of creatures claimed to be service animals has posed obvious problems for many restaurants and hotels in terms of safety, sanitation, and disturbance of other guests.   Until now, however, proprietors were largely powerless to bar these types of animals from their establishments.

The U.S. Department of Justice has issued new regulations effective March 15, 2011, however, which will substantially limit the types of animals that will qualify as service animals under the ADA.   First, only dogs (and miniature horses in some cases) will qualify as service animals under the new regulations.

"Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained," will not qualify.   The new regulations, however, do not place limits on breed or size of dog.

Second, the dog must be "individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability." The regulations go on to state that the work or tasks performed by the service animal must be directly related to the handler's disability.   Examples of work or tasks set forth in the regulations include:

a. Assisting sight-impaired persons with navigation or other 
tasks
b. Alerting hearing-impaired persons to the presence of people 
or sounds
c. Providing nonviolent protection or rescue work. 
d. Pulling a wheelchair
E. Assisting an individual during a seizure
f. Alerting an individual to the presence of allergens
g. Retrieving items such as medicine or the telephone
h. Providing physical support and assistance with balance and 
stability to individuals with mobility impairments
i. Helping persons with psychiatric and neurological 
disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or 
destructive behaviors

Under the new regulations, the mere "provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship does not constitute work or tasks" for purposes of the definition of service animal.   Thus, animals that provide only comfort or emotional support for their owners will no longer qualify as service animals.

For a dog to qualify as a service animal to an owner with a psychiatric disability under the new regulations, the dog must be trained to perform specific work or tasks.   Examples given in the guidance accompanying the new regulations of tasks performed by psychiatric service animals include reminding the handler to take medicine, providing safety checks or room searches for persons with posttraumatic stress disorder, interrupting self-mutilation, and removing disoriented individuals from dangerous situations.

The guidance also states that a dog that is used to "ground" a person with a psychiatric disorder will qualify as a service animal if the dog has been trained: (1) to recognize that a person is about to have a psychiatric episode and (2) to respond by nudging, barking or removing the person to a safe location until the episode subsides.

The new regulations additionally clarify that "attack dogs" trained to provide aggressive protection of their owners will not qualify as service animals.   The crime-deterrent effect of a dog's presence, by itself, does not qualify as "work" or "tasks" for purposes of the service animal definition.

The new regulations also formalize prior Justice Department technical assistance addressing the use and handling of service animals.   The regulations provide that a public accommodation may ask an individual with a disability to remove a service animal from the premises if the animal is not housebroken, or if the 
animal is out of control, and the animal's handler does not take effective action to control it.   (Ordinarily, the regulations state, a service animal shall have a harness, leash, or other tether, unless the person with a disability is unable to use a harness, leash, or tether or the use of such a device would interfere with the animal's ability to perform its work or tasks.) If a service animal is removed for any of these reasons, the person with a disability must still be permitted to access the establishment's goods, services, or accommodations without the animal being present.   The regulations also confirm that a public accommodation is not responsible for the care or supervision of a service animal.  The regulations provide that a public accommodation may not ask about the nature or extent of a person's disability, but that it generally may make two inquiries to determine whether an animal qualifies as a service animal; it may ask: (1) if the animal is required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task the animal has been trained to perform.   These inquiries may not be made, however, when it is readily apparent that the animal is a service animal, such as where a guide dog is guiding a blind person or a dog is pulling a wheelchair.   Furthermore, a public 
accommodation may not require documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal.   Nor may a public accommodation require a person with a disability to pay a surcharge for a service animal, even if it applies such a surcharge for pets.

These regulations will not apply to landlords or airlines, which are governed by the Fair Housing Act and the Air Carrier Access Act, respectively.   It is also not yet clear that these regulations, and particularly the definition of a service animal, 
will be applied by courts to cases brought under Title I of the ADA which covers employment.

A good argument may be made, based on existing case law, that a stricter standard would apply under Title I.   Unlike under Title III, where a dog must be allowed onto the premises if it qualifies as a service animal and does not leave a mess or cause a serious disturbance, an employee under Title I of the ADA is 
entitled only to such accommodations as are necessary to enable him or her to perform the essential functions of the job.

An employee, therefore, will likely need to show that the presence of a service animal is needed for the employee to be able to perform his or her essential job duties.   An animal that provides only comfort or emotional support to an employee, but that is not needed in order for the employee to be able to work, will not likely qualify as a reasonable accommodation under Title I of the ADA.

These new regulations give long-needed clarity to hotels, restaurants, retailers, and other public accommodations regarding which animals must be allowed as service animals, and under what circumstances.   No longer will these establishments need to allow patrons to bring exotic, dangerous, disruptive, or unsanitary animals with them as purported "service animals."

MCBVI Committee Reports

Constitution & Bylaws
Wayne Lepiors, Chairperson
  
HI everyone. I have nothing much to report about the Bylaws and Constitution at this time except I am still waiting for  a person or persons to get me a paragraph or two about junior and student memberships.  I listen to the    ACB membership focus meetings on the phone.  We talk about membership and how to get new members and young people into our charters and what we need to do to keep them interested so they will stay. There was a membership focus session at the ACB National convention  in Reno, Nevada and I attended it. David Ellingwood went with me, along with eight other people from MCBVI. We had a good time their.
   If you have any changes or additions to the constitution or bylaws you would like to submit to me let me know and we will work on it together. Call me at 810-982-8978. Well Happy holidays to one and all!

Nominations Committee
By Karla Fields, Chairperson

During the opening ceremonies of the Convention Joe Sibley notified members that due to a conflict of interest Matt Livingston could no longer run or serve as official treasurer.  Charis Austin resigned as assistant treasurer and was nominated to run on the ballot for treasurer.  John Jarzyna ran as first vice president, Pam Berryman as second vice president, and Mary Sibley as Assistant Secretary. All were elected by acclamation, so no election on Saturday was required. At our 2012 state convention the following offices will be up for election: President, Secretary, and Assistant Treasurer.  

Publications
Donna Rose, Chairperson

It has been a while since we have had a published newsletter.  My time is extremely limited due to my work, dialysis and my over all health issues related to kidney failure.  I am sorry this has affected my ability to get the newsletter out, and in the summer I told Joe I should resign.  Joe said he did not want to accept my resignation because he knows I really like doing it.  I don't know how much longer I can do it, and do it properly, but I do like putting it together.

You all can help me by sending me your chapter updates and committee reports by the specified deadlines, so the process can be completed quicker.  The next deadline for all submissions will be February 1, 2012.

Public Relations
Donna Rose, Chairperson

There are several of us working to let the public know of MCBVI's existence in our communities.  This is a job each chapter should be doing as well.  Prior to our state convention, all of the Lansing papers were notified of the weekend's events, and press releases were sent to local radio stations as well, including the local Radio Reading Service at WKAR-FM.

We also offered training to professionals to teach them general guidelines about working with those who are blind or visually impaired.  Information about this program was advertised far and wide in order to get as many participants as possible.  Next year we will start this effort earlier in order to get the word out sooner.  We had nine people present, mostly social workers, and two nurses.  We were able to offer social workers three continuing education credits for their attendance by applying through the state to do so in advance.

In the upcoming year we will definitely be getting a new brochure printed.  At our convention the membership has asked us to communicate better with members, so we will be working hard to this end.  Remember, though, we need to improve our financial outlook in order to have funds available to conduct regular organizational business, including better communication with our members.  That is where you come in.  Examine your own life and when possible join MCBVI committees.  We are in particular need of members interested in a fund-raising committee.  And there is an article earlier in this newsletter describing how you can join the ACB MMS Two for One program which would help MCBVI too.  We all need to be using our talents, big or small if we want our organization to thrive.

  
Chapter Updates

Blue Water league of the Blind - Port Huron Area
By Michael Geno, Former President

       The Blue Water League Of The Blind held an ice cream social last August, and shared a picnic with local area Lions in September.   At our October meeting we reviewed the latest GPS technology accessible to the blind, followed by a short business meeting.   We share a Thanksgiving dinner and fellowship in November, followed only two weeks later with a Christmas party.
  
       Twelve of our members  had a great time at   the MCBVI state convention in Lansing.   We plan an even bigger turn out next year.   We will make plans for 2012 activities at our first business meeting in January.   The BWL usually meets the third Thursday of each month.   But we do not have a meeting in July or December.   We enjoy an annual Christmas party with the Lions early in December, and spend time with our families and friends.   If you would like more information about our projects and events, please call us during day light hours at (810) 982-0717. Happy Holidays from all of us in the Blue Water League.

Capital Area Council of the Blind - Lansing Area
By Donna Rose, Member

The Capital Area Council of the Blind is at a crossroad.  We are looking for a new space in which to hold our meetings since Grumpy's Restaurant has moved to a location without separate room space.  Jim and Arlene are searching for a new quieter location.  We will be holding our holiday party at the new Grumpy's location since we made a commitment with the owner already.

Our chapter donated $300 to the convention committee to use for expenses to put on the state convention in October here in Lansing.  We also had several members who helped with convention preparations.  Members stuffed registration packets and Janine provided transportation to pick ACB President Mitch up from the airport.  Our chapter donated a wonderful basket of Michigan made goodies which were auctioned off at the MCBVI auction on Friday evening.  Jim and Arlene Moore donated a brand new microwave oven to the auction as well.  Those from our chapter who attended thought the weekend was a big success.  We want to wish everyone a Happy Hanukah and/or a Very Merry Christmas, along with a happy and prosperous new year. 
		
Kalamazoo Council of the Blind
Things Are Happening In Kalamazoo
By Marla Neubaum 

Kalamazoo Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired enjoyed a beautiful sunny autumn day at Husted Farms.  On Saturday, October 22, 2011, 9 KCBVI members, family and friends went to the apple orchard.  It began with a hayride.  The owner Mr. Husted drove the tractor through the apple orchards.  He was an excellent tour guide answering any questions we had.  He told us about the history of the farm and how many different types of apples and other produce they have available.  After the hayride had ended he gave us all samples of a couple different apples.  Of course anyone who has been to an apple orchard knows what comes next.  Doughnuts!  The group enjoyed fellowship while consuming doughnuts and cider both made fresh at the farm. Next the group went into the store to buy fresh produce.  The farm has several types of produce: squash, pears, peppers and every type of apple you could think of just to name a few. One of our members Sue Fluri is getting ready to take a trip to Australia and wanted to buy items made in Michigan to take with her.  She purchased honey, raspberry jelly and a few other items.  We had so much fun! 
 
Visually Impaired Persons for Progress (VIPP) - Grand Rapids
By Deb Wild

VIPP met in January, March, May, September and November of 2011 at the Grand Villa Restaurant. Our officers for 2011 are: Doug Koster, president; Mary Sibley, vice president; Tressa Conrad, secretary; and Casey Dutmer, treasurer. In November our vice president and treasurer were up for election. Casey was elected by acclamation for treasurer. Mary Sibley and Tom Shangle were running for vice president. Tom was elected by vote. His term begins in January of 2012. VIPP now has 48 members. We had a few new faces at November's meeting. The board put together a budget which passed in March. 

In March some of us attended the play "Hello Dolly" at the Civic Theater where local radio personality Andy Rent described the sometimes fast-paced action to us wearing headsets. Some of us attended the butterfly exhibit at Meijer Gardens in April where we could touch a few items: A huge bamboo trunk which felt very smooth, and banana leaves and other foliage. Some of us took a 45-minute narrated train ride around the gardens. In May there was a four-hour fund-raiser at Culver's Restaurant where a portion of the proceeds went to VIPP. Also in May there was a transit millage vote for 3.5% which passed. There is another voting opportunity in November. Please get out and use your AutoMark voting machines.  We attended a White Caps baseball game in June. Several of us attended the ACB national convention in Reno, NV in July. We learned a lot and had many fun times. In August we had a picnic at Wedgewood Park. In September we were presented fund-raising opportunities of purchasing VIPP hoodies and selling subs, croissants and garlic bread. There will be a Tastefully Simple Party in mid-November.  The bylaws will be sent to members for them to study before the January meeting. 

Many VIPPers were busy with MCBVI's convention in many ways. It was a joy meeting with you all there. The Thursday night dinner/cruise on the Michigan Princess was very enjoyable. 
   
Charis Austin and Mary Sibley put together a Comcast channel guide.
