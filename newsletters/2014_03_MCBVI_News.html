<h2 id="FromThePresident">FROM THE PRESIDENT</h2>
<p>By Joe Sibley</p>

<p>I am writing this with a lot of snow out my front door. 
Hopefully some of this will be gone by the time you read this. 
Oh well, it's winter in Michigan.
I like the fact that we have four distinct seasons, 
but I'm ready to move on to the next season. 
It's OK though I am blessed to have a
wonderful wife and many awesome friends in MCBVI.</p>
        
<p>Speaking of seasons before you know it our state convention will be coming up. 
The convention will be September 25 - 28 at the Four Points by Sheraton in Kalamazoo. 
Much more will be coming out soon; the convention committee is working hard to plan a great weekend for you. We work hard to keep the
costs down so I hope to see you at convention this year.</p>

<p>As you know in the past few years we have held an "event" on Thursday night to open our convention. This year I am excited to announce that we plan to
        offer "Out of Sight Night" on Thursday September 25. There will be a dinner and entertainment by a great band. This will be a fun activity for our
        convention attendees as well as an outreach to the community and will raise some much needed funds too.</p>
<p>The band is Beyond Sight, led by Steve and Rhonda (Selby) Scott who are both blind. This band is exploding in popularity and we will have a great time
        that night. Watch for details. Don't forget that Kim Charlson, president of ACB, will be joining us for our convention.</p>
<p>I am a little sad looking at this convention as it will be my last as your president. At the end of this convention I will hand the proverbial gavel
        over to the new president that you will elect. I will always be grateful for the opportunity that you have given me in my 3 terms as MCBVI president,
        and I look forward to the next chapter in this organization's history. MCBVI changes lives, it changed mine, let's all work together to take it to the
        next level. Tell your friends that aren't members, let's bring in more members to the family, the more we have the more we can accomplish to the
        benefit of all whom are blind or visually impaired in Michigan.</p>
<p>This issue is being put together by Malaina VanderWal, our assistant editor. Malaina and Donna Rose are a great team, I am proud of the MCBVI News. I
        want to thank both of them for their great service! Smile today, it never hurts! Joe</p>

<h2 id="MemorialToJeanetteGeno">MEMORIAL TO JEANETTE GENO</h2>
<p>By Gerald Clay</p>

<p>As our path with her life on earth ends, and Jeanette's new path  
begins, if I ever had a choice in a friend it would be Jeanette. 
Her strong belief in the church and God will help her in finding her way to heaven
knowing she will be met at the gates with a smile.</p>

<p>Jeanette will be remembered for her kindness and outgoing attitude. 
Her strength in life will carry on in heaven and she will be remembered for her
acts of kindness. 
On earth she will be remembered as a warm and friendly leader in our community.</p>

<p>Jeanette was more than a member in the Blue Water League of the Blind 
where she led this organization for many years where she will be tremendously missed. 
Jeanette's husband's love and devotion is an example of Jeanette's love of life,
 a precedent that should be followed by all.</p>
 
<p> Her battle in life and her ability to overcome and face life to the end is a role model to all who knew her. Jeanette's laugh, and "hi guys" will be
 remembered by all. 
 In our hearts Jeanette is not gone for she has left especial part of her in everybody that new her and loved her. Jeanette will be
 greatly missed throughout the MCBVI and the Blue Water League of the Blind community. 
 Go forth and rejoice with God in heaven our friend.</p>

<p> Thank you to everyone who worked to get your 2014 membership dues in on time. At this time we have 168 members, 2 below our budgeted goal of 170
        members. This does not mean that we want to stop there. There is interest in southeast Michigan, the Traverse City area, and we would like to start a
        student chapter. At this time we have five chapters: Blue Water League, Port Huron; Capital Area, Lansing; The Northerners, Cadillac; Kalamazoo Council
        of the Blind and Visually Impaired; Visually Impaired Persons for Progress, (VIPP), Grand Rapids; in addition, we have 22 members at large.
</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that MCBVI has changed the audio format to CD rather than cassette. Some information listed audio in
        terms of format and did not specify specific format for MCBVI and ACB. ACB indicates that if you order CD it will be a data CD played on the computer,
        not audio. If you are not receiving your format choice, please let me know. My contact information is:

<p>By Charis Austin, Treasurer</p>
<p>It is time that we start telling our officers what we think is important to us. 
We are at the place in organization history that we either need to say
 that we have to do some major fundraising efforts (which involve everyone),
 or we spend the money we have and in a few years the organization will be
 out of money.</p>
<p>At our January board meeting, we passed a budget with a projected deficit of $3,618.00. 
Our projected deficit for 2013 was $2,300.00.</p>
<p>Below is a list of items included in this year's budget. 
Note that donations and fundraising income are low amounts.</p>

<p>If the organization applies for grants, we need to show that our membership supports us beyond annual dues. 
There are two ways to do this: the first is to make donations through the ACB MMS Program. 
The second is to make donations directly to MCBVI. 
As Treasurer, my question to everyone is where do you
        want this organization to go and how do you want to get there? 
        How important is this organization to you? How can you help? 
        Give your ideas to the Executive Committee! Now is the time to act!!!
    
</p>
<h2 id="Fundraiser">THE EASY, ALMOST NO EFFORT FUNDRAISER</h2>
<p>By: Dr. Ronald E. Milliman, MCBVI member</p>
<p>This "Easy, Almost No Effort Fundraiser" is a way you can help fund your ACB state affiliate without having to do much of anything. 
You don't have to ask people for money. 
You don't have to participate in any fundraising walks, or sell raffle tickets or yard sales,
or anything of the kind. It requires just a tiny bit of information when initially 
enrolling in the program and after that, it is on automatic! 
You don't have to do anything more!</p>
<p>This is one fundraiser that if it sounds too good to be true, really is true! 
In fact, this fundraiser is so good that you can not only help generate
        much needed revenue for your MCBVI state affiliate, 
        but you can even help your affiliate's parent organization, 
        the National ACB, all at the same time!</p>
        
<p>When participating in the ACB's Monthly Monetary Support (MMS) Program, 
you simply enroll in the program and an amount, designated by you and
completely controlled by you, is automatically deducted from your bank account 
or charged to your credit or debit card each month. It starts when you
        want it to begin and will end upon your request. It is so easy. Once you enroll in the program, nothing more you or your MCBVI affiliate need to do.
        Everything is completely handled by our financial office. If you ever want to change the amount of your contribution, you can by simply contacting our
        ACB financial office. You can have up to 50% of the net amount of your contribution designated to support your state affiliate.
</p>
<p >
    PLUS: While they last!!
</p>
<p>
        As an expression of our appreciation for your participation in the ACB MMS Program, your affiliate president, your ACB National President, your ACB
        national Board, and the ACB's MMS Program Committee, are delighted to send you a pocket-sized, FM Scanner Radio when we receive your first
        contribution. This hi-quality, little FM radio comes complete with Braille and print operating instructions, Ear Bud earphones and batteries for your
        FM listening enjoyment.
</p>
<p >
    That's Not All…
</p>
<p>
        Anyone who has met the following criteria between the end of the 2013 ACB national conference and convention and the close of this next year's
        convention will be placed in the grand prize drawing. In the most recent years, the winners of these drawings have won such gifts as a Hamilton Beach
        talking microwave, a Humanware Victor Reader Stream, a GW Micro BookSense, a Touch Memo, a Bookport Plus, and an iPad. All you need to do is either
        enroll in the MMS Program with a minimum contribution of $10 per month, or if you are already enrolled in the MMS Program, just increase your existing
        contribution by a minimum of $5 per month.
</p>
<p >
    How Your Contributions are Used to Benefit You…
</p>
<p>
        By supporting your state's affiliate, you are also benefiting yourself. Your state affiliate needs funding to support its many activities, such as
        on-going public education campaigns, scholarships, social events, defraying the costs associated with conducting your MCBVI state affiliate's
        convention, producing your state affiliate's newsletter and other promotional and educational materials.
</p>
<p>
        The funds you contribute are also used to support the many benefits you get from being a member of the American Council of the Blind (ACB). These
        benefits to you include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The ACB Braille Forum, our Flagship publication</li>
<li>Support for ACB Radio, our exclusive internet radio network</li>
<li>Support your annual, national conference &amp; convention </li>
<li>Support for the paid staff and offices</li>
<li>Support for legislation that benefit you and all blind and low-vision people</li>
<li>Support to fight to maintain and increase your SSI and SSDI benefits</li>
<li>Support to make accessible paper currency a reality</li>
<li>Support for the fight for accessible point of service devices, e.g. ATM machines</li>
<li>Support for audible traffic signals</li>
<li>Support the fight to increase the use of descriptive audio for TV and movies</li>
</ul>

<p>
        When participating in this "Easy, Almost No Effort Fundraiser. You can support your state affiliate and the national organization, both at the same
        time, with a single contribution, two-for-one! Some members can afford more or less than others, and we certainly realize and respect that. All we are
        asking is that you help fund your state affiliate and our national programs with whatever monthly amount you can afford. We equally value everyone's
        contribution. To give you some idea, currently, contributions range from $10 per month and go all the way up to over $100 per month. To enroll in the
        program, just contact your state affiliate president or call the ACB financial office at 1-800- 866-3242 and have Nancy Becker assist you with filling
        out the required form or have one sent to you, or alternatively, you can access the form on our ACB website at:
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://www.acb.org/node/28#main-content">http://www.acb.org/node/28#main-content</a>
        . Or if you prefer, you can call me, Dr. Ron Milliman, Chair, ACB's MMS Committee, and I will be glad to answer any questions you might have and assist
        you by filling out the enrollment form over the phone and submit it to our business office for processing. My phone number is 270-782-9325, or you can
e-mail me your phone number, and I will call you, and we'll get it done, easily, with almost no effort. My e-mail address is        <a href="mailto:rmilliman@twc.com">rmilliman@twc.com</a>. Of course, if you have any questions about the MMS Program, you can call or write to me, and
        I'll try my best to answer all of your questions and assist you any way I can.

<h2 id="Non24">FDA APPROVES TREATMENT FOR NON-24 CIRCADIAN RHYTHYM DISORDER</h2>
<p>Non-24 is highly prevalent among the totally blind</p>
<p>
        WASHINGTON, January 31, 2014 - Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VANDA) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
        approved HETLIOZ™ (tasimelteon) 20mg capsules for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24). HETLIOZ™ is the first FDA approved
        medication for Non-24.
</p>
<p>
        Non-24 was first described more than 60 years ago, and is a chronic, circadian rhythm disorder resulting from the misalignment of the endogenous master
        body clock to the 24-hour day, disrupting the sleep-wake cycle. Non-24 affects the majority of totally blind individuals and it is estimated that
        approximately 80,000 Americans have the disorder.

<h2 id="FaceTime">Thinking Of Getting an IPhone or IPad</h2>
<p>By Malaina VanderWal</p>
<p>
        Are you thinking of purchasing an IPhone or IPad? 
        Perhaps you have just purchased one but have not unlocked all the helpful apps accessible to you? 
        In this article I am going to discuss an app I have found very useful for some of those tasks where it was helpful to have a sighted person but no one was
        around. This app is called FaceTime and it is installed on the IPhone or IPad out of the box.
</p>
<p>FaceTime is an app allowing two apple devices to make video calls. 
    It is similar to Skype in the respect it is a call made over a wifi or a cell carrier network. 
        It requires a phone number of the person with an IPhone or an email address for IPad users.
  </p>
<p>For instance, if you want to FaceTime with your IPhone and a family member with an IPhone or IPad you do the following. One double tap the FaceTime app
        on your home screen or location of the app. Two, double tap the contacts tab found at the bottom of your screen. This is the third tab from the left or
        the first tab from the right. It has three tabs along the bottom of the screen favorites, recent and contacts. Once the contacts tab is located double
        tap the name of the person you wish to call. The person's IPhone number or email address associated with their apple device must be in your contacts.
        Three once you double tap the name you want to call you're presented with the contact info. Four swipe from left to right with one finger until you
        find the facetime button. Five, double tap the facetime button and wait for the person to answer. A little story of how facetime has helped me in life.
</p>
<p>A few months ago I went to the house where two of my friends live. The three of us were going to make some tater tots in the oven. The dial however was
        not completely marked and we needed a different temperature from what was already labeled. I decided to use facetime to help us. I called my dad on his
        IPad and with his help we set the oven dial close to where it needed to be set. I held my phone so my dad could see the numbers on the dial and with
        some patients on his part and laughing on mine we set the dial! I have also used facetime to help me with identifying money when my IBill money
        identifier was not working. During our state convention last year I used facetime to talk to my nieces! Although I could not see them they could see me
        and it was great to talk with them for a few!
</p>
<p>The sound quality is usually very good and clearer than a regular phone call. Try it you might be surprised how useful this pre-installed app can
        benefit your life! Other apps will follow in the next issue of the newsletter. If you have something you would enjoy learning about on the IPhone
        contact me at

<h2>Committee Reports</h2>

<h3>Constitution &amp; Bylaws Report</h3>
<p>Wayne LePiors Constitution and Bylaws Chairman</p>
<p>    Hi all MCBVI People. I am working on some amendments to the Bylaws for assistant Secretary and Assistant Treasurer. The changes I am proposing are to
        get the Assistant Secretary and Assistant Treasurer the right to vote at all meetings. Now the current bylaws state, that the Assistant Secretary and
        Assistant Treasurer cannot vote when the Secretary and Treasurer are present. Please think about it so we can vote on it at the Business Meeting Sunday
        September 28th 2014 at the MCBVI Convention. If you can think of any other amendments let me know before Julys Board meeting where your opinion stands.
</p>

<h3>Convention Update</h3>
<p>By Casey Duttmer, Chairperson</p>
<p>The 41<sup>st</sup> annual state convention of the 
MICHIGAN COUNCIL OF THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED will take place at the four Points by 
Sheraton from September 25th-28 <sup>th</sup> 2014. 
Room rates will be $75 per night.
</p>
<p> On Thursday September 25
    <sup>th</sup>
    we will have an event called Out of Sight Night featuring the band Beyond Sight based in Kalamazoo. The band includes two blind members. This band has
        a following in the Kalamazoo and west Michigan areas. Tickets are 45 dollars which includes a meal and entertainment. There will also be a cash bar
        available.
</p>
<p>
        The theme of this year's convention theme is living without limits. 
        There will be meal packages available on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast, lunch
        and breakfast on Sunday. We will have a lunch option on Friday as the restaurant will not be open in the afternoon. When planning for this year's
        convention remember meal packages will count towards the cost of our meeting rooms. We need to reach a 2500 dollar minimum in order to receive a
        discount on meeting rooms.
    
</p>
<p>
        There will be a hospitality room Friday night but we are only permitted to bring packaged foods and bottled water and soda pop. The auction will be
        Friday night which is always a great time and the money is used to help defray costs for next year's convention. Saturday there will be morning and
        afternoon sessions and break outs to be announced. Kim Charlson,    
        president of the American Council of the Blind will be this year's keynote speaker and guest! Sunday we will have our business meeting. The convention
        committee will put out a full announcement of convention details at a later time but it will not appear in the newsletter.
</p>

</p>

<h3>PUBLICATIONS &amp; PUBLIC RELATIONS</h3>
<p>By Donna Rose, Chairperson</p>

<p>There is no public relations information to report to you at this time. 
But, there is news to report on the Publications front involving this newsletter. 
At the MCBVI Winter Board Meeting in January the Board decided, 
with my and Malaina's recommendation, to put out three, instead of four,
newsletters this year and re-evaluate this decision in early 2015, 
with the Board to determine if this change will be more successful for our budget 
and for timely publishing.</p>

<p>Also at that meeting we discussed the types of issues which hold up the newsletter writing and production process. 
Most of us involved have contributed to the delays in one way or another. 
As I have said on many occasions, I love working on and being editor of the newsletter. 
However, if we truly want a newsletter, and many members have acknowledged they do, 
we need to take the deadlines for submissions seriously. 
Although we are all volunteers sharing our time and talents, 
cooperation is of the utmost importance in order to complete any of our organization's business. 
This includes the newsletter too!</p>

<p>
   What does it take to write and produce our newsletter? 
   First, Malaina and I gather info for a few months from a variety of sources. 
   We send out an email reminder about the approaching deadline to those who have email addresses registered with us and ask people to remind those who may not have email. 
    Near the deadline time we discuss our plans for each issue. 
    After she gathers the committee reports and chapter updates she emails them to me
   along with other articles she has written or gathered herself. 
   Sometimes you might get a call or email from her as she tries to track everyone down for
   the necessary information about committees and chapters.
    
</p>
<p>
        We try to include as much information as possible in each newsletter. 
        When making choices about which types of articles are going to be included, we
        ask ourselves, is this info pertinent to our members here in Michigan or related to our organization, is it information that might be helpful to those
        who may not have easy access to it, and is it interesting enough? 
        When looking ahead at each deadline I try and leave blocks of time in my calendar
        just after the deadline so that all of these items can be edited, assembled, and formatted. When items roll in late it effects the time I have set
        aside. Then I must fit it into my schedule as best I can, which can also delay the entire process. 
</p>
<p>     When I finish the final draft I send it to Assistant Editor Malaina and President Joe for their take on it so we can change, 
        omit and/or add things one last time before sending it for production. 
</p>  Once it  has been put into final form it is given to President Joe and 
        First Lady Mary for brailing and copying it into large print. 
        Then to Asst. Treasurer Wayne who oversees the recording and copying of the CD version. 
</p>
<p>    Charis makes the mailing labels for the different formats and sends out the email
        version. Joe mails out the braille and large print formats. 
        Wayne sends out his CD copies. 
</p>
        
  <p>It is truly an assembly line of jobs, and at the end your
        newsletter arrives at your door. 
        So you can see how one glitch in this process can have an adverse effect on production timeliness.
</p>
<p>
       It is for this reason we need to make the deadline the deadline. Items for the next newsletter which are not submitted by or on the deadline day will
        be held for the following newsletter. We will remind you in advance, Put the next deadline in each newsletter and try to track you down as it gets
        close. But ultimately, this is your newsletter and it will be your responsibility to get stuff to us by the deadline.
</p>
<p>
        Malaina and I will need to talk to the board about a couple of things which could help the entire production process. 
        Since our organization is running in a deficit every year, we think these are two very good ideas. 
        First, at a state convention a few years back the membership requested they wanted
        better communication from the board. 
        They wanted a summary of each Board meeting's minutes included with each newsletter. 
        We also include all of our convention resolutions in the newsletter following the state convention as well. 
        The minutes take up about 10 or more braille pages and sometimes the resolutions even more. 
        We would like to hear from the board at the April meeting about placing the approved minutes from each Board meeting and
        resolutions from our conventions on the internet, and only offer them in alternative formats upon request. 
        About half of our members have internet access, 
        and we feel then we will only be sending them out to those who truly want to read them. 
        It will save us money and time to if we adopt this new policy. 
        Think about it! 
        We will be discussing this at April's Board meeting which will be by telephone. 
        You are invited to attend. 
        If you don't have email please contact an Executive Board member about the phone number and passcode to enter the conference. 
        We thank you in advance for considering the concerns raised in this report. 
        The next newsletter deadline will be June 15, 2014.

<p>By Malaina VanderWal, Chairperson</p>

<p>     It's time for me to begin thinking of assembling my resolutions committee. 
Last year I began the process much too late which left me scrambling at the
        end. 
        My committee members were great however and I was very grateful and appreciative of their hard work. This year my goal is to start earlier and
        hopefully not feel as rushed for time again. 
        I will be calling members of the committee from last year to find out if they want to participate. I
        welcome new members as well and my contact info can be located at the end of the newsletter.
</p>
<p>  Please contact me if you want to learn more on how you can help. 
Or if you have an idea for a resolution I will gladly talk it over with you.
        Resolutions give MCBVI something to work towards but it takes each member to follow through and not just vote yes on a resolution. If there is no
        follow through from us the members of MCBVI than the work the resolutions committee does will be a waste of time!
</p>

<h3>Chapter Updates</h3>
<h4>Blue Water League of the Blind</h4>
<p>By Gerald Clay</p>

<p>It has been a sad few weeks for the members with the passing of Jeanette Geno.</p>

<p>Our elections were held in January and I am pleased to announce Lindsey LaVere was elected our new secretary. 
This will help in adding an additional board member for the club.</p>

<p>In the coming months the BWL will start the process of revising its bylaws,
 since it has been some time since last reviewed and updated.</p>
 
<p>A reminder to all members, please help and participate in your club. </p>

<p>As windows XP is fading fast the BWL is looking for working lap tops for its hand
 me down program. These computers can be used for entry level computing and are great. 
 It has aided in the introduction of word processing and in one
 instance a computer was used in the aid of communication between a woman and a deaf man,
 by allowing her to type in which the gentleman was able to read the screen,
  while his wife typed on the key board. 
  It is this type of thing that the members of the BWL are proud of,
  helping in assisting the community.</p>
<p>If one wishes to contribute to the hand me down program,
 please contact the president thru the email link on the BWL web page.
  The web address is <a href="http://bwlblind.com/">http://bwlblind.com/</a>

<h4>Cadillac Council of the Blind</h4>
<p>By Cathy Daily</p>

<p>The members of the Cadillac chapter raised 95 dollars from a food drive,
 held in Lake City Michigan, and that money went to the Cadillac Council. 
 The members that help put it together were Carl and Rose Vanhaitma, 
 and Dujuna Wilkerson thanks to them for their hard work.
 </p>
<p>ose Vanhaitma was elected to vice president recently. 
Also the chapter began with just a few members and now we have 10 members. 
We hope to continue projects and expanding our chapter.</p>

<h4>Capital Area Council of the Blind Lansing Area</h4>
<p>By Donna Rose</p>

<p>   We did not meet in January. 
At our chapter meeting in February we had a very informative speaker on health care. 
She was from an insurance broker and had lots of good information about the Affordable Care Act,
         as well as Medicare Health Insurance, Medicare supplements, 
         and Medicare Part D Prescription plans.
</p>
<p>Our President, Ruth, has planned a mini fair of technology items available for those with low vision,
 to be held on March 4<sup>th</sup> at Royal Scott Bowling Lanes. 
 It will be a good way to advertise our chapter and get to handle and try out some cool items. 
 For more info on this, contact me and I can provide you with the exact details, 517-489-2233,
    <a href="mailto:wild-rose@sbcglobal.net">wild-rose@sbcglobal.net</a>
     (Please note there is a hyphen between the words wild and rose in my email address.)
</p>

<h4>Kalamazoo Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired (KCBVI)</h4>
<p> By Marla J Neubaum</p>
<p>
      KCBVI celebrated the holidays by having fun and fellowship at Louie's Trophy House Grill. 
      Which by the way I have to say they have the best fried mushrooms in the world. 
        We had a lot of fun sharing what our favorite Christmas gifts were when we were children. 
        The name was drawn for the $100 Meijer's gift card. 
        The winner was Karen Goidasik. 
        Karen works for the BSBP Training Center. 
        We continued the holiday spirit by singing Christmas carols and exchanged gifts.
</p>
<p>
        On Christmas day several of our members met at Ministries with Communities as a volunteer community project. 
        We assisted with handing out treats to theless fortunate while others handed out gifts. 
        Ministries with Communities fed them both breakfast and lunch. 
        It was a great experience, one we would like to do each year. 
         We also plan on getting in touch with this organization to volunteer at other times during the year. 
         We hope 2014 is great for all MCBVI members.
</p>

<h4>Visually Impaired Persons for Progress (VIPP) Grand Rapids</h4>
<p>By Malaina VanderWal</p>
<p> In January VIPP welcomed its newest member 
    Artemis Conrad, Tressa Conrad's Dog Guide and our guest Ed Howland.
</p>
<p>
       Casey Duttmer discussed the fundraiser for Opportunities Unlimited for the Blind (OUB) Winter Bowling Blast. 
       This will help to raise funds for summer
        camps which will now be held at the Indian Trails Camp. 
        There will be camps for students and adults.
        In May VIPP plans on another fundraiser held at
        Culver's restaurant home of the Butter Burger! 
        This event is great to attend. 
        The food is great and it gives us the chance to tell the public about our chapter. 
        Members of VIPP meet and greet customers as they enter and exit.
</p>
<p>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of February we will have our third annual game night. 
This social gathering is filled with fun games such as name that tune and a variety of other
        games everyone can play. 
        In June members of our chapter will also attend a Whitecaps baseball game,
         date yet to be determined. Hopefully since baseball
        was mentioned at our January meeting spring will not be too far off now! 
        All of us at VIPP hope you're all staying warm or having fun in the snow!
</p>

<h3>Summary of the MCBVI Winter Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Submitted by Secretary, Debbie Robinson</p>
<p>
	    The Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired Winter Board Meeting 
	    was conducted by teleconference on January 18, 2014. It began at 10:06
        a.m. and ended at 1:25 p.m. Four of the five chapters were present, 
        and two officers were absent. We had about 20 participants. The meeting agenda was
        approved as read, and the summer board meeting minutes were approved as e-mailed.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        President Sibley reported we lost long-time member Jeanette Geno yesterday morning 
        after battling cancer. We had a few seconds of silence for Michael
        Geno and family. Michael Smith shared funeral arrangements/location. 
        He is planning on recording the service for those who cannot make it. 
        A memorial page will be up on the Blue Water League web site with tributes. 
        Several updates were given regarding MCBVI members who have either had surgery or
        health concerns.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        This is Joe's last year as president. He shared goals for 2014: 
        To start at least one new chapter, 
        to continue developing the new MCBVI brochure, 
        to have One major fundraiser this year, 
        and to launch an MCBVI student chapter. 
        He discussed a possible Thursday night convention event/major fundraiser
        this year in Kalamazoo. 
        This would be a concert with two acts: 
        One featuring someone who is visually impaired and a headliner group. 
        He is in contact with people at the State Theater and Miller Auditorium at Western Michigan University. He had no information on concert expenses. The concert would
        need sponsors such as a company sponsor and a media sponsor to market it. 
        Later in the meeting, it was decided to give the executive committee
        authority to make the final decision about the concert. 
        Another option is to have an event with entertainment at the hotel which would not be as
        expensive.
    
</p>
<p>
        We decided to do committee reports since Charis was not present yet. 
        Casey reported on the MCBVI convention. 
        Please see your December newsletter for a report on last year's convention. 
        About 60 people registered. 
        He asked for $381.94 from MCBVI to bring the convention account to $1,500.00. 
        The 2014 and 2015 conventions will be in Kalamazoo at the Four Points by Sheraton. 
        This year's dates are 
        Thursday, September 25<sup>th</sup> through Sunday, September 28<sup>th.</sup>
    
        The hotel rooms will be $79 (this amount changed to $75 post winter board meeting) per night. 
        We can bring in only peanuts, mints and pop and bottled
        water for the hospitality room. 
        We will have to buy everything else from the hotel, 
        but the cost goes toward the meeting room. 
        The exhibits may only be on Friday because they have to be in the same room as the meetings. 
        We may offer meal options because the restaurant is not open all day. 
        Casey is looking for committee members.
        There was no activity for grants or scholarships. 
        We still do not have a grants chair.
</p>

<p>
        Casey reported regarding legislation that the Civil Service Commission has taken more things away from State employees and retirees. 
        There are healthcare issues with Obama Care. 
        On the federal level, there is HR3749 regarding inclusion of devices for the blind and visually impaired like CCTVs
        under Medicare. 
        This is a 5-year trial study program, with about $12 million made available. 
        We need to support this, so contact your house representative in Congress to support this bill. He also discussed the Accessible prescription drug Act. We are in the middle of an 18-month best
        practices process. 
        It is important for MCBVI members to contact pharmacies and Envision America to see which pharmacies will or will not be part of
        this process. 
        It is important to determine what the barriers are. 
        There are some barriers with insurance companies or the interpretation of federal law
        regarding controlled substances. 
        Not all pharmacies will do mail orders of controlled substances. 
        The only way to know is if people participate and
        share their experiences with Envision America. 
        Best practices are not requirements that every pharmacy has to meet.
    
</p>
<p>Be sure to get your dues and other information to Charis by February 15<sup>th to be </sup>
        counted. 
        She needs to know what format of Braille Forum and MCBVI news you want. 
        She can accept credit card payments this year but will add a dollar to
        each transaction to cover credit card fees. We have around 164 members.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        After much discussion, it was decided to produce three newsletters in 2014,
         rather than four and to re-examine this in January of 2015. 
         The deadlines will be February 15, June 15 and October 15. 
         Work continues on the MCBVI brochure. 
         The mission statement committee has not met yet. 
         Writing a memorial tribute for Jeanette in the MCBVI newsletter and/or the Braille Forum was discussed.
    
</p>
<p>    
        Wayne reported he is working on a proposed bylaw change 
        to allow the assistant treasurer and assistant secretary voting members at board meetings, 
        even when the secretary and treasurer are present. 
        This will be presented at the summer board meeting in July, 
        with the final vote at convention. John and Charis are working on other changes.
    
</p>
<p>
        Malaina reported the resolutions passed last fall were published in the newsletter. 
        She has to determine who will serve on the committee. 
        The Accessible prescriptions and accessible labels resolution did not get addressed 
        in a timely manner.
</p>

<p>
    Karla reported no candidates are running at this point. 
    The offices up for election are president, secretary and assistant treasurer.
</p>

<p>
        Jackie reported the goals for technology are to continue using a wireless microphone 
        for workshops and break-out sessions as we did at our last
        convention; to broadcast more information to the radio audience, 
        including streaming interviews with exhibitors; 
        expanding use of MCBVI radio for programming other than convention material. 
        Another goal was creating an MCBVI radio page on our web site with an accessible link to MCBVI radio.
    
</p>
<p>
       They are looking into the advantages of purchasing and using Station Playlist software while streaming. 
       It is an automated program. A basic version runs around $100, and is very accessible for JAWS users.
</p>
<p>Technology is requesting a budget amount of $600.00 to upgrade things.</p>

<p>  Charis reported on fund development. She discussed ACB's MMS program. 
In her financial report, the Investment portfolio total balance on 12/31/13 was
        $39,515.18. 
        Total income from 01/01/13 to 12/31/13 was $4,130.16. 
        Total expenses from that same time period were $5,181.22, 
        resulting in a net loss of $1,050.54. 
        There was much discussion on toll free usage, with the amount being about $500.
    
</p>
<p>     She reviewed the proposed budget for 2014. 
Total proposed income was $5,000.00. 
Total proposed expenses were $8,218.00, 
with a projected deficit of $3,218.54. 
One item was budgeted of an amount of $500 
for attending the ACB midyear board meeting/legislative seminar.
 Originally John and Joe were thinking of going, having submitted a much larger amount. 
 The executive committee decided to give Sara Conrad this $500.00 as a stipend. 
 She will be there anyway as part of ACB's board. 
 She agreed to represent MCBVI as well. 
 There was much discussion on the budget/deficit. 
 The proposed budget was approved as submitted, as was the above financial report.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        Casey reported on Opportunities Unlimited for the Blind (OUB) activities. 
        We made a donation last year to cosponsor a music camp. Due to changes the
        State made, OUB will be using Indian Trails rather than Camp Tuhsmeheta this summer.
         They are thinking of setting up a schedule of five weeks of camp
        starting in June. It costs about $1,200 per person per week for camp. 
        It was decided to table this till we get more information on camps and
        sponsorship levels.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        We need to know by April the delegate from each chapter. 
        Chapter charters were discussed. 
        There is interest in beginning a chapter in Traverse City and
        in the Jackson area.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        After much discussion it was decided to have the July board meeting by teleconference.
         It will be, due to the ACB convention, on 07/26/14. 
         It was also decided to move the spring board meeting date to
          Saturday, 04/26/14 due to Easter. This will also be by teleconference.
