And More
 

From the President
By Joe Sibley

I am writing this just having returned a few days ago from the ACB national convention in Louisville. Other than coming home with a nasty sinus infection it was a wonderful experience. I am very proud of the 20 members who made the trip, Michigan's largest delegation in years. It was a wonderful moment for me to request 21 chairs at the roll call Sunday night, and we received some nice cheers for that. We also received some very nice compliments from ACB leaders from across the country on our way of handling the Executive Order situation, more on that later. 16 of us rode the bus down which was a lot more fun than playing the airport game. Thanks to Charis and Kyle Austin for coordinating the bus along with Lenger Travel Service. I won't tell you Kyle's new nickname. We do plan to have a bus to go to Columbus next year so please plan to join us! It will be a shorter ride and you can enjoy the company of your friends.

I have been trying to decide whether to say this publicly or not. With our current financial situation I have not asked MCBVI to support me as your president to attend the ACB national convention or mid year meetings. When it was looking like I wouldn't be able to make the trip this year, two of our members who wish to remain anonymous contacted me and offered to fill in the financial gap. Neither was asked, they just made the offer. At first my pride said no, but I was very touched that they thought it was important for me to be there so I finally accepted. Other members helped me too. I am humbled and moved beyond words and wish to publicly thank those who helped me attend the conference. I just hope I represented you well during my time there.
Mary was not with me in Louisville, she was working at Camp Tuhsmeheta this summer for Opportunities Unlimited for the Blind. I have to admit this is the first year I have really been involved with Camp T. I have seen personally the impact this camp has on our young blind and visually impaired kids, not just at camp but at OUB's "camp in a box" locations. OUB is taking some great directions, despite very tight funding, and mediocre cooperation from the Department of Education which owns the camp property. We need to support OUB. These camps are making an impact on these kids, and these kids are our future.

OK, let's get to the executive order 2012-10. As you will remember when executive order 2012-2 was released in February we as an organization did not protest or picket, we did our research and presented our concerns to the governor's office and offered to be a cooperating partner. I believe you will find 2012-10 much more acceptable, one of our largest concerns from the beginning keeping blind rehab services a separate bureau from the general agency. I again want to thank everyone in MCBVI who was involved in this process. We still have some details that will have to be settled, but I am optimistic that we will have fine services for Michigan's blind and visually impaired citizens when all is done. You can see my column in the last issue of MCBVI news for more details. The press release regarding EO 2012-10 will follow in this issue. I also wish to thank Governor Snyder, along with Mike Zimmer, chief deputy director of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs for welcoming us to the table and accepting our input.

Finally although we need prayer and support for a few of our members who are having serious health issues right now, I want to acknowledge a miracle. On August 6 our newsletter editor Donna Rose will receive a new kidney which is being donated by one of our members, Suellen Hozman. Donna has been struggling with kidney failure for years which has been a serious burden in her life, but this gift she is receiving is a gift of a new life. I'm sure I speak for all of MCBVI when I say go Donna, we are behind you!
Enjoy your summer and see you in Lansing in September for the MCBVI convention!

Snyder issues revised executive order to enhance services for people with disabilities - Wednesday, June 27, 2012
LANSING, Mich. - Following collaborative input from Michigan residents with disabilities, Gov. Rick Snyder today issued Executive Order 2012-10 with changes that will better leverage expertise and resources to meet their needs.
     
Today's Executive Order transfers the duties of the Michigan Rehabilitation Services to the Department of Human Services and reconfigures the Michigan Commission for the Blind as the Bureau of Services to Blind Persons within the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA).
     
Snyder previously issued Executive Order 2012-2 last February, but it was rescinded in April to work with advocates to ensure the best possible services for residents who are blind or visually impaired. The new E.O. maintains two separate entities to address needs of people with disabilities and keeps services to blind persons, including the Business Enterprise Program (BEP), within LARA. Today's E.O. reflects the recommendations of federal and state advocates to provide the best customer service and resources to Michigan citizens. 
     
     
"After discussion and collaboration with disability advocacy groups and individuals throughout Michigan, this executive order provides for efficient delivery of services while, at the same time, addressing the specific concerns and suggestions of citizens," Snyder said. "I want to thank those who participated in this productive process to ensure the very best services for Michigan residents with disabilities."
     
Richard Bernstein, an attorney and advocate for protecting the rights of people with disabilities stated, "I thank the governor for his willingness to work with the blind community and their advocates to address our concerns. By working together, we've been able to ensure the continuation of essential services for the blind in Michigan."
One of the recommendations implemented in the executive order, and based on stakeholder input, is assurance that BEP related to businesses on federal property and the Business Opportunity Act will remain within LARA.
     
"We are pleased that the Governor and other involved officials have been very receptive to our input," said Joe Sibley, president of the Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired. "I am confident when the dust settles that we will have fine services for the blind and visually impaired in Michigan, and the amazing staff of the Commission for the Blind will be able to continue the great work that they do."
     
The E.O. also appoints the director of the new Bureau of Services for Blind Persons and Michigan Rehabilitation Services to serve as ex officio members of the newly-created Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services, which will include a range of individuals with disabilities and advocacy groups. It also clarifies the requirement in the federal regulations for the Talent Investment Board representative on the Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services.
     
The order also mandates an implementation date of Oct. 1, 2012 for all portions of the order except matters related to the Disability Concerns Commission, whose transfer to Department of Civil Rights takes effect 60 days after the order is filed. This provides time for public meetings and amendments to the two new bureaus' state plans.
     
"We appreciate the Governor's willingness to work openly with us in developing plans to strengthen services for the blind," said Dr. Fredric K. Schroeder, first vice president of the National Federation of the Blind. "In particular, we appreciate his commitment to keeping these services within a single agency to ensure that programs are coordinated and administered by individuals with specialized training and experience in blindness."

Congratulations to Sarah Conrad

On behalf of the MCBVI Executive Committee, I want to congratulate MCBVI Member, Sarah Conrad, on her election to the ACB Board of Directors at the national ACB convention.

Sarah is an MCBVI Member At Large. She attends Calvin College and is majoring in Special Education. She just finished a term as President of ACB Students.

Join me in congratulating Sarah!

A Brighter Future in MCBVI and ACB
By Sara Conrad, President ACB Students
	
Throughout my years with ACB and MCBVI, I have seen a major issue with student membership, or the lack there of, across our organization. As the President of the American Council of Blind Students, I have set out to reduce this age gap and increase the presence of younger members in ACB as a whole. In doing so, the topic of student chapters within state and special interest affiliates is inevitable, and I have set out to help states join with ACB Students to create affiliates for student groups.

At this time, California is the only affiliate of ACB to have an established student chapter. I am proud to say, however, that Michigan is on the move! We are eagerly working to create a student chapter and implement student-friendly programming that will encourage younger membership in MCBVI. 
While I do not have much to report on the status of the logistics of such an endeavor, I do want to stress the importance and true excitement brought with this change. 

We see the issue of age in ACB, where very few scholarship winners attending national convention continue on with ACB, and these winners are the majority of our student recruits each year. In addition, after hosting five focus group conference calls with more than 30 ACB leaders, I was made aware of the issue of programming for young people in affiliates, as state affiliate presidents lamented of unsuccessful membership retention efforts at their local chapter and state convention meetings. 

Although the process here in Michigan will take some time due to state constitutional requirements, there are other promising changes taking place within ACB for the recruitment and retention of young people. First of all, ACB Students Second Vice President and Convention Chair Caitlin Lynch of New York and I are currently forming a new mentor program for national scholarship winners that will begin this summer in Louisville. This program will include communication between ACB Student leaders and winners, networking students with their state affiliate presidents, and encouraged attendance at student and state events throughout convention. In addition, we will be contacting students before and after convention for continuity, in hopes for greater success in keeping them hooked within ACB.
Furthermore, ACB Students is diligently working to form a program called Adopt a Student which would assist young adults in attending national convention. We realize that this event is crucial in the membership retention of young people and hope to see increased involvement from state and special interest affiliates in our efforts as we continue to create the program. I will be speaking in Louisville about these efforts as well as student membership in general, with hopes to encourage our affiliate leaders.

In closing, I am honored to work with the leaders of MCBVI to establish the student chapter and organize new programming. It is our intention to help the membership as a whole for the future of ACB. Together, we will grow student involvement and see this brighter future shine. 


Update on Accessible Prescription Labeling
By Malaina VanderWal, Asst. Editor

During the last few months I have worked on bringing Accessible Prescription Labeling to the Grand Rapids area.  I have communicated with En-Vision America the manufacturer of the script Talk, which will read aloud relevant information contained on a prescription label.  This device will allow the user to view prescription information in the privacy of his/her home. This would eliminate asking for assistance if one is unable to read the printed label.  

Do to the fact the Grand Rapids population of blind and low vision individuals is wide spread, some of us discussed changing pharmacies.   This would assume we could find and agree upon a central location for all to take part in.  This is a challenge in itself because several things must be taken into consideration.  These range from location in proximity to one's home among others.  Most pharmacies that would be more likely to provide accessible prescription labeling are the small independent pharmacies.  

In order to try and learn if anyone of the pharmacy chains such as Rite Aid or Walgreens offers any type of accessible prescription labeling, I contacted the Rite Aid pharmacy I use.  I learned they currently offer a low vision solution but not one for someone who is totally blind.  They gave me a number where I could contact headquarters.  I called and asked if they provided accommodations for those who are blind and visually impaired.  They asked for my name, the store number of the Rite Aid I used and my phone number where I could be reached.  I ended the conversation with the feeling that I probably would not hear from anyone.  A few days later I was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the Rite Aid district manager!  I explained what I would like in accessible prescription labeling and he seemed very receptive and said he would look into what could be done.  I also gave Rite Aid a print out of the information on En-vision America's website regarding the Script Talk.  In addition, I contacted a couple of local Walgreens and one said they could provide a low vision solution and another said they did not have anything available.  

In the Grand Rapids area some of us have contacted the pharmacies we use in an effort to bring this to our area.  If you want to do the same I will provide numbers to three of the big chains. The number to Rite Aid is 18007483243, Walgreens's 18009254733 and CVS is 18007467287.  

What you can do to help spread the word if this is an important issue for you.

    Contact your pharmacy and explain to them you want accessible prescription labeling.  Explain what it is and describe how beneficial it would be and how it would put an end to the possibility of medication mistakes.  
Progress is being made on this issue with the passing of accessible prescription labeling language going through the senate and for language making it into the final package when it reaches the President's desk.  Also, in the last few days Wal-Mart has implemented a pilot program.  Currently it is through their mail order service and in three of its stores.  The mail order service is available for anyone wanting to participate. Unfortunately none of the in-store locations are in Michigan but it gives me hope this shall become obtainable in more pharmacies regardless of whether using an independent pharmacy or a large chain!  While I was in Louisville at the ACB convention, I am pleased to report that thee Accessible Prescription Labeling Act was signed by  President Obama!  Thanks to everyone for their work on this issue for helping it pass quickly!

For any questions or more information on how you can get accessible prescription labeling in your area contact me at Malaina@iserv.net    .


What Is a Mitzvah?
By Donna Rose, Editor

About a year ago my friend Suellen asked me what she would need to do to offer me a kidney.  I have been on dialysis for three years and the waiting list for a kidney transplant could take as long as 5-7 years.  A kidney from a living donor usually works twice as long as one which comes from a deceased donor, approximately 15 years.  When she first asked me I called my transplant center in Grand Rapids and was told by the donor nurse that their center doesn't take any living donor over the age of 65.  I was disappointed because Suellen is slightly over this age limit, but after another whole year of dialysis and all of the health complications related to it, I recently contacted them again explaining my friend is willing to step forward and she is in good health and I would really like her to be screened.  After Suellen went through oodles of tests we were told they would do the surgery.  She was a good match. We are having surgery on August 6th at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Rapids.  This gift will change my life significantly.

Suellen tells me that giving me one of her kidneys is a "mitzvah" for her.  I had heard this word previously since I have several friends who are Jewish, but this is the first time I ever began to understand its real meaning. To compare this word to an English language equivalent may not convey the exact meaning, but basically it means obeying the commandments in the Torah.  It is a good deed or human kindness which you might extend to someone regardless of how well you know them.  But I think the meaning is also about a sacrifice involved to improve the life of another which ultimately gives back, or pays forward goodness to the world.  It might not be easy, nor does it have to be martyrdom.  I think it is about using your talents and/or resources to help individuals, thus improving our world.  I strongly believe that this good can become contagious to others just by releasing such behavior into the cosmos.  

Having a person offer me such a life saving gift has made me do some real soul searching over the past few weeks.  It has made me take stock of all of the people who have helped me, as well as all of the people I may have helped.  It has prompted me to think about ways I can do more mitzvahs myself.

MCBVI has many people living up to the philosophy of the "mitzvah".  While I won't mention all of their names here, because I am certain I would leave someone out, we all know of the wonderful dedication of many of these folks.  They don't know us all personally, but yet they give of their time and talent, as well as other resources, because it is the right thing to do to improve the lives of others.  

A friend of mine was once in a grocery store when a woman with a lot of groceries and a bunch of young children was checking out ahead of him.  He asked if he could pay for her groceries and she was overwhelmed by his kindness.  It turned out that her husband had recently lost his job and my friend's assistance would be very helpful to their family.  The bill was over $100, which for the time was a pretty large chunk of change.  I am certain she wondered why he did this.  

When I was about 12, I was walking over to a friend's house when I came across a little boy about 6 or 7 years old.  He had just fallen off of his bicycle.  He was carrying a gallon jug of Kool-Aid to his cub scout meeting.  Of course the container had sprung a leak, and he had gotten scraped up.  He was worried that his mom would be mad at him for this accident.  I gave him sympathy for his predicament, and offered to walk him to the place of his meeting, trying to carry the container in such a way we wouldn't lose too much more of it.  When I look back on this incident I remember him crying and can still feel a pang in my heart for him.  I couldn't improve the situation completely, but as we began to walk he stopped crying.  I think he was glad that someone older had come along and was willing to stop and help.

People don't always think they have the resources necessary to help others, but if you examine yourself thoroughly you will see there are ways you either are doing, or could do a mitzvah for someone else to make their life better or more comfortable.  It doesn't have to involve money, or giving up a vital organ, but these examples should encourage us to do our best to leave the world a better place than when we came into it.  

I love you Suellen.  Thank you for stepping forward to give me a new life!

Publications & Public Relations
Donna Rose, Chairperson for both

We will only have three newsletters published this year.  The next deadline for submissions will be November 1, 2012.  This has been a year filled with a lot of breaking news about the abolishment of the Commission and its restructuring.  This has postponed our newsletter as we wanted to keep you as up-to-date as we could about these developments which could affect us all.  My health has been poor this year, but the good news is I will soon be getting a kidney transplant.  This is why the next deadline for the newsletter is November 1.  By then I should be well enough to get it ready.  

Malaina is now the assistant editor and she will be gathering your chapter updates and committee reports.  Her phone number and email address are listed at the beginning of this publication.  If you are a chapter president or committee chairperson, please get your updates and reports to her by the deadline so the process can move along as smooth as possible.  It seems like these things slowly trickle in, sometimes taking a whole month or more after the deadline.  If items are too late then formatting becomes an issue because I have to cut and paste them into the already created document and it can ruin the previous formatting for some reason.  If you don't have a report please just email or call Malaina and let her know.  Active chapter should always have updates for us.

Joe and I will be working together to create a new brochure once I thoroughly recover.  I am looking forward to feeling better with more energy so I can participate more in our organization. 




Technology Committee Report
Jackie Boomstra, chairperson

The Technology Committee has been hard at work these past few months. Our web site has been updated. Please visit it at www.blindmi.org     and browse around.

This year all of our committee members have installed and configured Duckstream on our computers and will be able to assist with streaming the MCBVI convention.  Mike Geno conducted training for us on Winamp which is a media player and we all have it configured correctly on our computers. We also have acquired our own audio streaming service and will be streaming the MCBVI convention using this service. Having this service is very exciting   because it opens up an exciting new world of opportunities and possibilities for us. In the near future, we will begin streaming media that promises to be entertaining, educational and a lot of fun! It should be a great place to tune in often. We will keep you updated on our progress with this.

If you have questions or want more information, please email me at jackieboomstra@sbcglobal.net     or call me at 616-455-6069.

At the April MCBVI Board Meeting
April 21, 2012

Editor's Note:  The following summary is from draft minutes taken by MCBVI Secretary Deb Wild during the April board meeting which was conducted via teleconference.

     After housekeeping and approval of the winter board meeting minutes, MCBVI President Joe Sibley discussed Executive Order 2012-02 which was signed on 02/24/12. This disbands the Commission for the Blind as it stands now, placing it under the auspices of the Department of Human Services (DHS). Joe wrote a draft position statement from MCBVI, and Neal Freeling and Charis Austin reworked it. This was then sent to the governor's office. In March, Michael Geno, Casey Dutmer and Joe Sibley met with   Mike Zimmer of LARA and Brian Rooney, Deputy Director of DHS, who was present by phone. They wanted to work constructively with MCBVI. The old executive order will be rescinded this week. There will be a media release about this. A new executive order will be reissued which will not take affect until 10/01/12. MCBVI will be part of the restructuring process. There will be seven people on the advisory board, including some who are blind. This board will represent the concerns of   all blind/visually impaired citizens of Michigan.  There will be a Rehab Council for the blind and the Commission board. They will work in the Bureau of Services program within DHS. BEP will also be restructured. There will be significant changes in the new executive order. Mike, Casey and Joe saw the draft which shows many good things. The Bureau of Services for Blind Persons is the new name which may change. It was decided to wait until the announcement of rescinding the executive order and the press release were received and then get the newsletter out.
     Everything is updated on the web site. Our web guy Bill Cresswell has made it easier to post material. He set up a blog for discussion of news and information. We need someone to monitor it. We now have our own stream for MCBVI radio which will have programming, information and special events. It is not public yet. The technology committee is being trained. We found a service to do this very inexpensively. Mike Smith has been the point person. It is hoped everyone will be willing to participate in program blocks.
     Charis gave the financial report. As of 04/18/12, the checking account balance was $2,820.37. As of 03/10/12, our $20,000 CD is ready to reinvest again if the board agrees. Total income was $3770.42. We had good direct public support of contributions at $250.00. To generate cash, we sold the Oppenheimer fund of $1,281.18. Total expenses were $2,239.62.
Net income was $1,530.80. We may need some of the $20,000.00 CD to help our operations.
Matt is researching putting together a new portfolio as recommended by a new adviser of Merrill-Lynch. Charis e-mailed Matt to get more information. 
     Casey reported our convention will be at the Best Western Plus in Lansing, formerly the Causeway Bay Hotel. The dates are 09/13-09/16/12. The convention theme is Planning Our Future Together.

     Michael reported there were no grant applications. Mary reported there were no scholarship applications.
     Casey reported HR4087, regarding accessible prescription labels, has 251 sponsors. There is a Senate version coming out with similar language. We were urged to contact our Congressmen and senators. 
     MCBVI member Malaina VanderWal has been very involved with En-Vision of America regarding the ScripTalk Program that blind/visually impaired people can use to read their prescriptions. Pharmacies must purchase part of the device. She has contacted local pharmacies and Posted information about the bill and how we can sign the petition. He discussed HR860, the Accessible Vehicle Donation Act, which needs our support, Executive Order 2012-02 and other bills in various stages of process.
     Charis sent in money for 160 members. Since then three more members have paid. Three more have expressed interest but have not paid. One Young member is very interested in starting an affiliate. Attempting to start a new chapter in the Detroit area was discussed, along with various challenges. This has MCBVI's support.
     The newsletter was discussed. As mentioned before, May first is the next deadline. Information can also be sent to Malaina. Sending Donna a get-well card from the board from Joe and Mary's Braille stock was discussed. The new MCBVI brochures are in the works. There are still a lot of old brochures. Regarding constitution and bylaws, there was no activity.
     Deb and Casey reported for Resolutions which met once since January. Faith Meadows has joined the committee. Many things were discussed, but no resolutions were drafted. The deadline is 08/06/12. Unfortunately since that meeting Pam thought it necessary to resign as chair due to health concerns.     
     Karla reported the offices up for election are president, secretary and assistant treasurer. Jo is running for president. Deb is running for secretary. Wayne is running for assistant treasurer. Contact Karla, Casey or Arlene Moore if you wish to run for these offices or have any candidate suggestions.  
     Joe and Michael reported for Jackie regarding the technology committee which continues to meet by Skype. Members are Jackie Boomstra who is chair, Michael Geno, Joe Sibley, Mike Smith and Marcia Moses. MCBVI radio was discussed. It was asked if testing could be done at the July board meeting. They could possibly use Skype to monitor a test of MCBVI radio. There will be a link to MCBVI radio on our web page. ACB radio/world will be used to stream our convention. 
     The Last Planning and Quality (PAQ) meeting a week ago was canceled and has not been rescheduled at this time. All committees are in limbo. Regarding the Consumer Involvement Council (CIC), Phyllis reported they met on 04/12/12. Bob Robinson discussed the Training Center for the Blind. A gentleman who is a veteran would like to join which would add an extra chair to the CIC board. They would like to have a veteran on the board. Richard Bernstein discussed transportation concerns in Detroit. SMART and DDOT have gone to court several times. There is a great need for the blind and disabled from Detroit to participate on advisory boards. There are bills in the works for public transportation. People in Detroit may want to contact Transportation Riders United. People can also contact the Let's Get Moving Coalition in Lansing. The future of CIC is uncertain, but it will be business as usual through the summer.
     The July 21 board meeting room is reserved at the Best Western Plus Hotel. Lunch will be paid for by MCBVI. Information was disseminated for the bus trip to Louisville. We will leave on 07/06 and return on 07/14/12. Since this meeting the date of return has been changed to 07/13/12. There is no count at this time. Cost may be in the $200 range per person.
Charis was appointed to collect all the contact information. 
     Regarding Opportunities Unlimited for the Blind (OUB), Casey is chair. The Department of Education agreed to provide food services. James Baird was hired as camp director. It costs $100-150 a weekend. They are working with Amway for a grant which will help pay for staff and equipment. Gwen Botting was asked to be the Director of OUB. Bridget Smedes is administrator, and Mary Sibley is assistant administrator. The future looks good. Some camps are a gardening weekend, a family camp, LIO camps, a culinary camp, a music camp, a braille camp, a science camp, plus off-site activities. There will be an event at Camp Dearborn. They would like to see MCBVI donate funds. It costs $350 to $450 to run the camps.
     Regarding fund development, we need people who are willing to devote time and think outside the box. We may need to revise our mission statement. Charis Austin will be committee chair. Carl Daily, Casey Dutmer, JoAnn Pilarski and Wayne Lepiors are willing to serve. Joe Sibley is an ex officio member. Many things need to be discussed such as what is our purpose for raising this money? What good things do we want to do and how much will it cost to do them? The MMS program was again discussed.
     The Cadillac chapter is working with local transportation sources to get numbers of approximately how many handicapped people and how many blind people use these services. They are working with a senator's office. There are eight members.

It was asked about certificates for chartering chapters. There is a charter ready for each chapter with a logo on it. Charis has certificates and frames.  
     The Commission board will meet in June and maybe September. At a Kalamazoo Training Center presentation, Sharmese tried to get folks to come to the Kalamazoo chapter meeting. Things fell through after she had transportation all set.  It was suggested that MCBVI do a presentation with food or a fun activity. We would have to clear this with the director. The meeting was adjourned at 1:41 P.m.
