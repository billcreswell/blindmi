<h2 align="center" >From the President</h2>

<p align="center">By Joe Sibley</p>
<P><br/><br/></p>
<P>As I sit down to write my second to last president&rsquo;s message I
hope you are enjoying the long awaited Michigan summer. I have about
3 more months to serve in this office, and then at our convention in
September you will elect a new president.  Since 2008 when you
elected me to my first term a lot of water has flown under the
bridge. When I was elected I was just getting to know Mary, then we
started dating; now we have been married almost five years. I have
moved twice. Of course many things have happened in MCBVI that I have
been involved in. Some of my goals we have achieved, some not. I do
know that it has been a pleasure and an honor to serve as your
president. I know it has helped me grow personally and I have had
many amazing experiences, most good, some challenging that I will
always treasure. Most of all, I love the people in this organization.
I enjoy working alongside so many great people who work hard to
benefit the lives of all citizens of Michigan who are blind or
visually impaired.</p>

<P>Granted it does get frustrating some times, knowing what MCBVI could
accomplish with a better fund raising picture, and a little more
involvement using the many untapped talents in our membership, but I
am very very proud to be a member of MCBVI the positive voice of the
blind community.</p>

<P>I really hope to see you in Kalamazoo September 25 &ndash; 28 for our
annual convention. If you have never been to a state convention or
haven&rsquo;t for a long time, this is the year to give it a try. We
work very hard to keep the expenses as low as possible while offering
you a great weekend. You will read more later in this issue, but I
again want to bring up that Kim Charlson; president of the American
Council of the Blind will be joining us. I also want to remind you
that Thursday September 25 will be Out of Sight Night, a fund raiser
and friend raiser featuring the band Beyond Sight. I am hoping for a
great crowd for a fun evening to kick off our convention. Let&rsquo;s
be blunt, if there is a reason you might choose not to attend our
convention, I would like to know it, or if there is more we could
offer that would encourage you to join us I would like to know that
too. Our annual convention is one of my favorite events of the year.
The fun, the education, and the fellowship we enjoy are truly
exceptional. Please consider joining us in September.</p>

<P>We are updating many of our outreach materials right now. We have
revised our mission statement which you will see in this issue. We
have a new logo almost completed for our brochure, website, Facebook
page, and other printed materials. We should have our new updated
brochure complete before the convention. This is all to share the
message of MCBVI as the state&rsquo;s positive, productive leader in
the blindness community.</p>

<P>As we countdown my last days as president knowing that a new president
will take this office on September 28 at the end of our business
meeting, I think it is time to reflect and ponder. Where would you
like to see MCBVI move forward from here? What would you like us to
do as an organization that we are not doing? What are we doing wrong,
what are we doing right? MCBVI is your organization and we need your
input and participation! Consider joining us for our summer board
meeting on July 26 starting at 10:00am. It is a phone conference so
you can join us without leaving your home. Although only officers and
chapter delegates can vote, everyone is welcome to share their
thoughts and ideas. Please join us, see what is going on, and voice
your opinions.</p>

<P>I am very sad to share that Casey and Sharon Dutmer are moving out of
state shortly after our convention. Casey has been a leader in the
blindness community for many years. He has served as MCBVI president,
legislative chair, convention chair and many other tasks over the
years. He has been an advocate for transit, accessible voting, and
much more. When he married Sharon she jumped right in and has worked
hard alongside Casey in everything he is involved with. Most of all
Casey and Sharon are wonderful people who I am proud to call my
friends. They are moving to Seattle where Sharon&rsquo;s daughter and
grandchildren are. Casey is already connecting with the Washington
Council of the Blind and they will be blessed to have them. I&rsquo;m
sure we all send them on their way with our love and good wishes.</p>

<P>Finally before the convention I want to thank the members of the MCBVI board,
all of the leaders, and you the members who have been outstanding to
work with for the past 5.75 years. We have a great group of people
who really care about this organization and the blind in Michigan. I
will remain on the board as the immediate past president and I look
forward to working with the new president as we push forward in our
mission to change the lives of all in Michigan who are blind or
visually impaired. Most of all I would like to thank my wife Mary who
married me in 2009 and has supported me always and has made my life a
joy every day.</p>

<P>Enjoy the rest of the summer and we'll see you in Kalamazoo in
September! &ndash;Joe-</p>

<h2 align="center">2014 MCBVI State Convention</h2>

<p align="center">
<SPAN STYLE="text-transform: uppercase">Save the Dates:  Sept. 25-28</SPAN></p>
<p align="center">By Casey Dutmer, MCBVI Convention Chair</p>

<P><br/><br/></p>

<P>We are in the month of July, which means convention time is only two
months away. Dates of the convention are Thursday, September 25
through Sunday, September 28th. It is taking place at the Four Points
by Sheraton in Kalamazoo. The room rate is $75a night plus tax.</p>

<p>We will have meal packages for Friday lunch, Saturday breakfast,
Saturday Lunch, Sunday breakfast and of course, the banquet. I
encourage convention attendees to use as many of these meal plans as
possible because the more we spend on catered meals will reduce the
cost of the meeting rooms.
</p>

<p>The theme of this year's convention is <em>&ldquo;LIVING WITHOUT
LIMITS.&rdquo;</em> Our featured guest speaker at the banquet and
participant is Kim Charlson, President of
<abbr title="American Council of the Blind">ACB</abbr>.</p>

<p>Thursday night&rsquo;s entertainment features a band called BEYOND SIGHT. Two
members of the band are blind and visually impaired. Tickets are $45
per person. This includes a meal which will be a Pizza Buffet. The
price of this ticket also pays for the band, the cost of use of the
room, and will help raise money to defray some of the costs of the
convention. Please support this band and MCBVI.</p>

<p>On Friday morning there will be a tour of the Training Center and in the
afternoon the exhibit area will be open. (Note that the exhibit area
will only be open on Friday afternoon this year.) Exhibit space is
limited this year so if you are interested in exhibiting, please
contact Charis Austin to reserve your table. Her phone number is
(616) 532-4737.
</p>

<p>The Friday night auction has been popular. Remember to bring donations
(new unused) for the auction and door prizes.
</p>

<p>Saturday will feature a variety of presentations regarding the theme.</p>

<p>Registration materials will be out in early July. Register early so you can take
advantage of early registration rates. Please contact me if you have
questions 616-534-0581 or <A HREF="mailto:casey354@comcast.net">casey354@comcast.net</A></p>

<h2 align="center">Medications and You</h2>
<p align="center">By Kyle Austin</p>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>Do you know what medications you are taking, how many refills you have
left, and do you always remember instructions for taking the
medication?&nbsp; Do you know the warnings for your medications? Are
you tired of asking for help from people who are sighted? Well, that
is where I was in December, 2013.&nbsp; At that time I was not sure
if I wanted to get my medicine by mail.</p>

<p>Now I can say I love it.&nbsp; I have gone with CVS.com and it is working
out well for me.&nbsp; I now feel more independent because I know
what medications I have and the number of refills available to me.&nbsp;
It is great to know that when I call to do my refills if there are
questions they will call me back.</p>

<p>MCBVI has passed resolutions regarding accessibility of prescription
labels. I know that there are other places you can contact to do
this.&nbsp; You just need to do it now.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t then
the ability of getting your medications in a format you can use could
go away if you don&rsquo;t use the service.&nbsp; We all need to take
advantage of services like this.&nbsp; Otherwise, don&rsquo;t
complain later when it may not be available to you.</p>

<h2 align="center">My Experience with Wal-Mart and Walgreen&rsquo;s Accessible Prescriptions</h2>
<p align="center">By Donna Rose</p>

<P><br/><br/></p>

<p>If you are like me you probably are excited about having prescription
drugs with the instructions and other information available to you. I
began using Wal-Mart Pharmacy in January because my Medicare Part D
plan gave me a better price there.  About four months ago the
Wal-Mart pharmacist ordered the ScripTalk reader for me.  It arrived
in the mail at no charge to me in a very short time.  It works
wonderfully!  The pharmacists have had to put a special note in my
file so they remember to put the scannable tag on the bottom of the
bottle, but the process is getting smoother and smoother with each
prescription I fill there.</p>

<p>Recently Walgreen&rsquo;s announced that they were introducing a bottle that
reads your prescription information out loud to you.  It is different
from the ScripTalk.  I was excited about this because I often have
access to transportation and they have a drive-through unlike my
Wal-Mart.</p>

<p>I dropped off a prescription there to get an accessible bottle only to
be told that they don&rsquo;t have any of them in stock.  The
pharmacist called me later to let me know when I need a prescription
to let her know so she can get the supplies which could take two
days.  But I needed my prescription that day.  I am going to call her
back and see if she would be willing to keep them in stock.
Otherwise their program may not work for me.</p>

<p>My point here is to go to the pharmacies offering the accessible methods
and work with your pharmacists to work out any kinks.  Before long
you will be able to expect such services everywhere as the industry
adapts to the reality of this need.</p>

<h2 align="center">Getting Organized to do Fundraising</h2>
<p align="center">By Charis Austin, Treasurer</p>

<p align="center"><br/><br/></p>

<p>NOTE:
 The information included in this multi-part article is taken from
information received from one of our members, Dr. Ronald (Ron)
Milliman, a retired Marketing Professor. It is hoped that this
article will stimulate discussion and action to raising more funds
for MCBVI and as a secondary goal ACB.
</p>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>Fundraising:
 We talk about doing it but there always seems to be something that
prevents it from happening: time, someone else will do it so I don&rsquo;t
have to, I don&rsquo;t know how, or the best excuse of all I don&rsquo;t
like asking. Be assured that we are like all other non-profit
organizations I am aware of; we all need money and each organization
must work hard to get it. Money does not grow on trees.</p>
<p>We
have established a committee to work on fundraising but it never got
off the ground. This committee needs to start working. If you are
interested in serving on this committee, please contact me.</p>
<p>The
committee will need to assess the strengths and limitations of our
organization when tackling a fundraising project. We must objectively
consider and evaluate the following:</p>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<OL>
    <LI><p>Our organization&rsquo;s mission statement (Does your fundraiser fit
    within the limitations of your organization&rsquo;s mission
    statement?) At the last board meeting we authorized the Executive
    Committee to approve a new mission statement.
    </p>
    <LI><p>The
    financial resources available to invest in a fundraising effort
    (Often it takes money to make money.). We need to work out a budget
    based on how much we want to raise and how much money it is going to
    take to do it.
    </p>
    <LI><p>Human
    resources available to successfully execute a fundraiser (Do you
    have the &lsquo;horses needed to pull the wagon?&rsquo;?) We are
    spread out. What kind of fundraiser will work for us?</p>
    <LI><p>Expertise
    and experience within our organization with various types of
    fundraisers (Do any of our members have any applicable experience
    with any fundraisers that could be used to our organization&rsquo;s
    advantage?)</p>
</OL>

<P><br/></p>

<p>After assessing the strengths and limitations of our organization, we need
to objectively consider and evaluate any factors external to our
organization that could impact the success or failure of any
fundraisers we might consider.  Toward that objective, consider the
following:</p>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<OL>
    <LI><p>The state of the economy, both currently and the likely future</p>
    <LI><p>Any known projects conducted by any other organizations that might
    conflict or compete with ours</p>
    <LI><p>Any laws or government regulations that effect any possible fundraisers
    (In most states, gaming laws and regulations effect some types of
    raffles or drawings, games like Texas Hold &lsquo;em, bingo, etc.)</p>
    <LI><p>Sources for recruiting any volunteers you might need</p>
</OL>

<P><br/></p>

<p>Weather considerations (Outdoor fundraisers like walk-a-thons, fishing
tournaments, yard sales can be successes or failures depending on the
weather.)</p>

<p>It is not unusual for the
members of a non-profit organization to say something like: &ldquo;We
should have a fundraiser of some sorts so we have more money to work
with.&rdquo;  This is really not the right approach.  We first must
determine, specifically, what our organization needs the money for;
that is, does our organization need funds to reduce the deficit in
our budget, rejuvenate our grant program or to be able to offer one
or more student scholarships, to launch a public education program?
Precisely why do we need money?
</p>

<p>At this point I would like to hear from members. In my last article I
detailed the 2014 budget and resulting deficit that was adopted
during the January meeting. I only heard from a couple people. Why
did you join MCBVI? Are you getting what you wanted out of the
organization?</p>

<p>In the next article, there will be a discussion regarding forming a
committee to plan the event to raise the funds. Please contact me
with your ideas. I can be reached at (616) 532-4737 before 9:00 pm or
by email at <A HREF="mailto:charis533@gmail.com">charis533@gmail.com</A>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get thinking about where we want the Michigan Council of the Blind
and Visually Impaired to go.</p>

<h2 align="center">Things You Might Not Know About SIRI for the iPhone or iPad</h2>
<p align="center">By Malaina VanderWal</p>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s virtual assistant Siri is great for many tasks especially when you&rsquo;re
just getting used to the iPhone or iPad. However Siri and dictation
are not always available or cooperative. Noisy situations make using
Siri very difficult and most of the time difficult and frustrating.
Siri is very helpful but it is not a substitution for learning how to
type on the touch screen or if you have a Bluetooth keyboard that may
be easier.</p>

<p>However, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say people who use Siri on their iPhone
use it for making phone calls, sending a text or scheduling
reminders. But, Siri offers much more and I will share some of the
funny and interesting things for which I use Apple&rsquo;s virtual
assistant and how it helps me in my life. Some of the things may or
may not surprise you. Now let&rsquo;s have fun with Siri!</p>

<p>Did you ever have a day when you did not want to get out of bed but
needed to go to work or school or another activity and forgot to
watch the weather report? If so not to worry you can ask your iPhone
or iPad. Just hold down the home button located at the bottom of the
device. Say something like (will it rain today?&rdquo; Siri will
reply with an answer. Earlier today I told Siri &ldquo;it was cold
outside.&rdquo; She replied &ldquo;hardly its 81 degrees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is fun to ask Siri silly things such as &ldquo;what does the fox say,
or why do you work sometimes and not at other times.&rdquo; Siri can
be very helpful too with each update to apples IOS system Siri learns
new skills.</p>

<p>There are moments when because of the number of apps on my phone I do not
want to search for a particular app. I can just ask Siri to open it
for me and it does usually without a problem. Siri can also look up
information for you such as calorie information for a type of food. I
like to ask Siri questions about fruits or vegetables and it will
tell me all about that type of food. Ask Siri &ldquo;how many
calories are in one apple or how many calories are in a pint of
raspberries.&rdquo; Siri will give you all of the nutrition content
available for that food item.</p>

<p>If your trying to look for directions to a location but do not know the
address but, know the name of the location no problem Siri to the
rescue! Tell Siri you need directions to a restaurant of your choice.
The virtual assistant will then give you options to choose from and
once you pick your preferred option, Siri will ask, &ldquo;If you
want to call or do you want directions.&rdquo; If you ask for
directions Siri will open the Maps app on your device and you can get
turn by turn directions quickly.</p>

<p>There are so many interesting tasks Siri can help you learn about or help
you do every day. Explore with Siri ask questions it may have
limitations but Siri may also surprise you with its usefulness! All
you need to do is ask to unlock the power of Siri!</p>

<h2 align="center">Door to Door Organics Delivers All Over Michigan</h2>

<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>By Malaina VanderWal, chair</p>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>Why does MCBVI need to write resolutions every year? Lately I have been
asked this question and the quick answer is resolutions guide the
Michigan Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired. As an
organization we compose resolutions when we want to change policy or
support a law. Often MCBVI will write a resolution in support of
ACB&rsquo;s resolutions showing our state&rsquo;s support and
approval. Whether a resolution is written for the state or national
level once MCBVI adopts it we agree to take action. In the past we
pass resolutions and then we do not have any follow through. I hope
to see this change in the future! Some people may not want to be
political but unfortunately politics is how as a society we affect
change and we want MCBVI to be heard!</p>

<p>This year we have three returning committee members
and one new member who agreed to join the committee. The returning
members are Casey Dutmer, Neal freeling and Faith Meadows. I am
excited to welcome our newest member of the resolutions team Becky
Kooistra. She will make a great addition and she is one of our VIPP
members. I am eager to work with each of them!</p>

<p>The resolutions committee met by conference call recently and we
discussed some ideas for possible resolutions. Now we want to hear
from the membership. What ideas do you have for resolutions? What
direction do you as a member want the organization to take? Are there
issues you want us to take an active role in? Let anyone of the
committee members know your ideas! We all have a voice and we
encourage all to voice his or her opinions.</p>

<p>Submitting a resolution idea can be accomplished by contacting a committee
member or by emailing me. Make sure if writing a resolution idea that
you are clear about the issue and what course of action you wish
MCBVI to take. The committee will make sure each (whereas and there
for be it resolved) are in their proper format.</p>

<p>The deadline for resolution suggestions whether by phone to one of the
committee members or by email will be August 25th, 2014 at 11:59 Pm.
This will give us the time necessary to polish any resolution still
requiring work.</p>

<p>Here is how to reach the committee by phone along with my email address.</p>

<p>KCBVI joined other businesses and vendors for the June 2014 Art Hop in
downtown Kalamazoo. This is the 2<SUP>nd</SUP>
Art Hop we have participated in. &nbsp;We passed out brochures, sold
popcorn and 50/50 raffle tickets.&nbsp; The winner of the 50/50 won
$40 and the popcorn popper could barely keep up with so many people
attending the Art Hop.&nbsp; KCBVI will be purchasing an industrial
popcorn popper for future fundraisers.&nbsp; These are great

<h4>Capital Area Council of the Blind</h4>
<p>By Donna Rose</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>Our chapter now has 32 members.  In May we held a small technology fair
at Royal Scott Bowling in Lansing.  Our presenter was Enhanced Vision
which is a company operated by Jerry McCormick out of Livonia. He
brought several low vision and talking devices for people to see and
touch.</p>
<p>At our June meeting member Pat Cannon gave a talk about his experiences
on the Federal Access Board to which he was recently appointed by the
President. He described tours he had attended.  Did you know, for
example, there is a scale model of the Empire State Building that you
can touch?  His wife gave out information on a new local organic
grocery delivery service which delivers to many places in Michigan.
There is an article about it earlier in this issue.</p>
<p>We are not holding a meeting in July, but in August Joe Sibley is hoping
to come and visit us.
</p>
<p>There are lots of plans for the future of our chapter.  We have more
speaker ideas and are talking about having a social get together at
our meeting in October, Either a day or evening event at a local camp
ground where several members have RVs.</p>
<p>We usually meet at the Delhi Caf&eacute; in Holt on the first Tuesday of
the month from 11:30 AM until about 1 PM.  If you would like to
attend a meeting please join us, or for more info contact Donna Rose
517-489-2233.  We will see you all at convention.  Enjoy a great
summer!

<h4>The Northerners &ndash; Cadillac Area</h4>
<p>By Cathy Daily</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>We had a bake sale in the last few months to raise money for a banner
for our chapter and raised 142.17. We also donated various items for
something called a Baby Drive in the area. Various clothes items such
as onesies, hats, blankets and other baby clothes were donated. Also
activity and coloring books were donated for the children to use when
their parents were having a baby. The nurses were very appreciative
of the activities since they do not have much for the children to do.
These activity books give the kids something to do while they wait
and that can sometimes be a long time!</p>
<p>Our group is thriving and doing well. We have a new member Raelyn
VanderCook and we are happy to have her in our chapter.</p>
<p>The chapter has picnics planned throughout the summer and there is
something for all the members. Who does not enjoy a good picnic? We
hope you all enjoy the great summer weather from all of the
Northerners!</p>

<P>On May 28<SUP>th</SUP>
we had a Culver&rsquo;s Fundraiser from 5:00-9pm. Thanks to all the
members and volunteers who helped make it a success. On June 19<SUP>th</SUP>

VIPP picnic at Wedgewood Park from 12:00-3:30 pm.</p>

<p>Offices for election in November will be president and secretary. We held a
special election at our May meeting in order to elect a new Treasurer
to complete the rest of Casey Dutmer&rsquo;s term. Congratulations to
Kyle Austin our new treasurer. Thanks to Casey for all the years of
service to VIPP!</p>

<P>This fall our good friends and members Casey and Sharon Dutmer will be
leaving our group to head for the great state of Washington. Casey
and Sharon have done just about everything for&nbsp; our group, from
President to Convention chair to fundraising chair, treasurer,
secretary and much, much more.&nbsp; They were always there and
always willing to help out. Casey and Sharon, you may be moving but
you leave behind so many awesome memories and a Legacy of what a true
MCBVI member really is. We wish you a smooth transition and all our
best, along with heartfelt thanks and appreciation for all you have
done!</p>

<h3>Summary of the MCBVI Spring Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Submitted by Secretary Debbie Robinson</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>The MCBVI spring board meeting, conducted by teleconference, was held on
04/26/14 due to Easter. It began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 1:12
p.m. We had 22 participants. The
meeting agenda and the minutes from the winter board meeting were
approved as submitted.</p>
<p>Joe reported in his president&rsquo;s update that Ann Bratsberg will work
with us for another year at no additional cost. Short presentations
and video PSAs will be created from the videos we already have and
put on our web site. This is Joe&rsquo;s last term. He hopes to do
several chapter visits. He discussed the Fundraiser &ldquo;Out of
Sight Night&rdquo; on the Thursday night of convention in Kalamazoo.
Sponsors are needed. After Dinner we will be entertained by the band
Beyond Sight. His goals are to have a major fundraiser; to get at
least one new chapter started; to complete the new brochure. He
discussed the Michigan Bureau of Services for Blind Persons board. A
lot of research is being done, and reports will soon be submitted to
the governor. There are three subcommittees: One regarding the
Training Center in Kalamazoo, one regarding consumer services and one
regarding the Business Enterprise Program (BEP). The meetings are
open to the public and audio streamed. Casey and Sharon are moving to
Seattle, WA after our convention to be closer to grandchildren. The
VisionAware web site was discussed, offering many resources.</p>
<p>Charis reviewed the financial report prepared by Matt Livingston.</p>
<p>As of&nbsp;April 18, 2014, our reconciled checking account balance was
$3,875.10.</p>
<p>Total investment portfolio balance as of&nbsp;March 31, 2014 was
$40,398.60.</p>
<p>Total Income from January 1-April 18, 2014 was $2,175.74.</p>
<p>Total Expenses for the same period was $3,444.89.</p>
<p>Resulting Net&nbsp;Loss was -$1,269.15.</p>
<p>The main toll-free number is the only Sprint number we have left which
should result in savings. We discovered we were paying for toll-free
numbers even though we were not using them.
</p>
<p>Casey reported the MCBVI convention theme is Living Without Limits. The
dates are 09/25-09/28/14. ACB president Kim Charlson will be our
banquet speaker. Many details were discussed, including Friday
seminars and a possible tour of the Training Center for the Blind.
Some resolutions may be read and voted on Friday night. He discussed
the Saturday morning sessions with several speakers. There will be
three afternoon break-out sessions. The hospitality room will be
different this year in that we can only bring in limited items.
Preregistration is $20.00 and $30.00 after the deadline.</p>
<p>We still have no grants chair. There was no grants or scholarships
activity.</p>
<p>Regarding legislation, Casey reported on the State level there are proposals on
how to pay for road repair, but nothing has been agreed on. The issue
of retired state employee pensions may be determined by our next
governor. On the federal level,
there is HB3749 regarding inclusion of devices for the blind and
visually impaired like CCTVs under Medicare. He also discussed the
Accessible Prescription Drug Act. We are in the midst of an 18-month
best practices process. Call CVS.com or Walmart or Envision America. It
is necessary to determine what the barriers are. So far few blind and
visually impaired members are participating in the mail order
prescription process. The only way to know what these barriers are is
if people participate and share their experiences with Envision
America. There may be new legislation by 2016 for proposing new voting machines.
We need to make sure we have accessibility to independently vote.
</p>
<p>Charis reported we now have 175 members and our first junior member under
age 18. If you want to use this phone conference call number for a
committee meeting, check with Charis first, for another meeting may
have been previously scheduled.</p>
<p>Donna reported for public relations and publications. The brochure needs to be finished.
Malaina did an excellent job with the last newsletter. The deadline
for the next newsletter is 06/15/14. Donna and Malaina Will now be
coeditors. We discussed whether or not the MCBVI board meeting
minutes should be in the newsletter. Several years ago during a
Sunday morning business meeting, the membership voted to include a
summary of each board meeting in the newsletter rather than the
minutes. We decided to keep things as they are for now. This may be
further discussed. Use of Fillmore was discussed for reading
publications over the phone. This is only $5 a month. This will be
explored. Greater use of the internet and our web site was mentioned.</p>
<p>Regarding constitution and bylaws, Wayne is working on changes for allowing the
assistant secretary and the assistant treasurer to vote at all
meetings. The proposed amendment will be in June&rsquo;s newsletter
and will be read at July&rsquo;s board meeting.</p>
<p>The resolutions committee has not met yet. Contact Malaina with your
ideas for resolutions. A resolution regarding Bureau of Blind Persons
was discussed concerning consumers. Follow-through on resolutions
that have been passed was discussed.</p>
<p>Casey reported for Karla regarding nominations. John Jarzyna is running for president. Debbie
Robinson is running for Secretary. Wayne Lepiors is running for
assistant treasurer. If John becomes president, he can appoint
someone to finish his term as first vice president, but the board
must approve the appointment.</p>
<p>Jackie reported for technology that they purchased Station Playlist software
which helps with internet broadcasting for streaming. They may stream
interviews with exhibitors and people with Small businesses. The
Sunday morning business meeting will be broadcast on the MCBVI web
site. The ACB radio events channel will be used for the rest of the
convention.</p>
<p>Regarding fund development, the MMS program was mentioned. There will be a
sponsorship flier for Thursday night&rsquo;s Out of Sight event at
our convention.</p>
<p>There is interest in forming a chapter in Macomb County.</p>
<p>Casey updated us on Opportunities Unlimited for the Blind (OUB) and Indian
Trails. There was a bowling blast for the blind fundraiser last
winter.  There is a gardening weekend coming up. There will be an
adult technology camp, a blindness immersion camp and an adventure
trip up to Charlevoix. They have received grants for transportation
and a couple scholarships. It costs $1,200 to sponsor a week of camp,
including food and staff. It was decided that MCBVI will donate
$600.00 to OUB and not worry about giving them any information about
MCBVI till we get the brochure done. This includes a $100.00 donation
from Mr. and Mrs. Pat Cannon. $500.00 was budgeted for this.
</p>
<p>The mission statement committee has not yet met. We are working on the
logo for the brochures. It was decided that the executive committee
approve the brochure logo and the mission statement with input from
the board. We had a moment of silence to remember Jim Moore. We were
updated on Michael Geno. The ACB convention in Los Vegas was
mentioned as was Visions 2014 in Ann Arbor in May. The summer board
meeting will be later than usual, held on Saturday 7-26-14.</p>
